# Landje ROBOT 3D Printer Parts

The Landje robot is made up of various 3d printed parts.
You can download the stl-files for the different parts directly from the [LandjeRobot](https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/tree/master/3D%20Design) GitHub repository.

The parts shown on the [blog](http://reddipped.com) or in the guides are printed on a Ultimaker 3 using original Ultimaker PLA and PVA filament for best results. Optimal UM3 Profile settings for printing these parts are available in the folder [/3D Design/UM3](https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/tree/master/3D%20Design/UM3).

You can always change the model to your needs. The original design is available on [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/dualnxm5zyQ-landje-robot).
