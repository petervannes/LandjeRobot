# Landje ROBOT 3D Printer Parts

The Landje robot consists of several 3D printed parts.
You can download the .stl files for these parts directly from the [LandjeRobot](https://github.com/reddipped/LandjeRobot/) GitHub repository.

The parts shown on the [blog](http://reddipped.com) or in the guides are printed on a Ultimaker 3 using original Ultimaker PLA and PVA filament for best results. Optimal UM3 Profile settings, LandjeRobotFine.curaprofile, for the robot parts are available in the UM3 folder.

You can always upgrade or adopt the model to your own needs. The original design is available on TinkerCad.
