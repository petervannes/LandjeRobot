    <p>You can read a lot about programming. But you learn it mainly by doing yourself, making mistakes and solving those yourself. Searching for and solving errors yourself is called debugging.</p>

    <p><strong>Why is searching for and troubleshooting errors called debugging?</strong> A &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is a little, beetle or insect. Long ago computers consisted of electric switches. Between these switches, a beetle or fly could get stuck and blocking the switch. Because of the stuck switch, the computer no longer worked properly. To make the computer work properly again, the bug, beetle or fly had to be found and removed to make it work properly again. The syllable &quot;de&quot; in debugging means undo or remove. So debugging literally means removing an insect and comes from the first program error ever found.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_1">Landje Robot</h2>

    <p>So you're going to try a lot yourself, puzzle and learn from your own mistakes! You will do this with a robot, Landje Robot. Landje Robot is capable of the following things if you program it well;</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Driving around</li>
        <li>Follow lines</li>
        <li>Stay within a line marked area</li>
        <li>Measure distance to another object</li>
        <li>Dodge other objects or robots</li>
        <li>Flashing a light.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2 id="toc_2">Programming language</h2>

    <p>To program you use a language. A language that your computer understands so you can explain what it should do. There are many languages, some languages are very suitable for writing games, others are better equipped to make complex calculations. If you start with programming there is a good chance that you do this in Scratch. With Scratch, you can make a program by sliding blocks together. </p>

    <p><img src="./Student%20guide/Scratch_Hello_World.png" alt="Scratch Hello World" /><br>A simple example of a program in Scratch.</p>

    <p>Hardly any programming language works like Scratch. Most programming languages require you to write a command to let the computer know what to do. Writing a program is more difficult than programming with Scratch. This is because a computer is very precise and very stupid (really!). A computer only understands you if you tell it exactly what you want. </p>

    <div>
        <pre><code class="language-none">// This is understood by the computer
Serial.println(&quot;Hi&quot;) ;

// This the computer does not understand
Serial.Println(&quot;Hi&quot;) ;</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Do you see the difference between the two instructions ?</p>

    <p>Programming Landje Robot will be done in the programming language C (<em>see</em>). As you could see in the previous example, English words are used here.</p>

    <h1 id="toc_3">Lesson 1, Your first program</h1>

    <h2 id="toc_4">Arduino Create</h2>

    <p>In this lesson you will write the first program. Programs can be written in many ways, but usually you do this with a program that helps you with writing programs. Such a program is called an Integrated Development Environment. A mouthful, that's why everyone is talking about an IDE. The IDE you are going to use is &lsquo; in the cloud &rsquo;. You must have heard this term before. It means nothing but that you can use the program anywhere in the world if you only have an internet connection and a computer.</p>

    <p>You will use the IDE Arduino Create. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Start <em>Chrome</em> and go to the internet page <a href="https://create.arduino.cc">https://create.arduino.cc</a>.</li>
        <li>Click the <em>Arduino Web Editor</em> button to start the IDE.</li>
        <li>You are now on the login page but do not have a valid username and account yet. </li>
        <li>Click now under <em>create a new account</em> on the button <em>sign up</em>.</li>
        <li>Think up a username and password. Make sure you write down the username somewhere. Make up a password that <strong>You</strong> can easily remember, but is not easily guessed by anyone else. </li>
        <li>Enter your e-mail address.
            <li>To create your account you must prove that you are not a robot. Read the command carefully and execute it. If you do this correctly enough you will have shown that you are not a robot and your account will be created.</li>
            <li>To log in you must prove that the e-mail address is really yours. Look in your mail and click on the link you received from Arduino.</li>
            <li>Succeeded ? Then try logging in now. If this went well the screen will look like the picture below.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img style=" display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;" src="./Student%20guide/create.arduino.cc.png" width="600" alt="Arduino Create"></p>

    <p>To start the IDE click on the button <em>Arduino Web Editor</em>. In the IDE you can click on various tabs on the left. Click on <em>Sketchbook</em>. A program in this IDE is called a <em>sketch</em>. To the right of the <em>Sketchbook</em> you will see sketches that you have saved in the book.</p>

    <p><img style=" display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;" src="./Student%20guide/editor.arduino.png" width="600" alt="Arduino Create"></p>

    <p>Now create a new sketch by clicking <em>NEW SKETCH</em>. A new sketch automatically gets a name like &lsquo;sketch_jan11b&rsquo;. This is often not useful, it would be clearer if the sketch is called <em>my first sketch</em>. </p>

    <div style="overflow: auto;margin: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">
        <img style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;" src="./Student%20guide/doe_icoon.png" width="50" alt="Doe" />
        <div>Try to figure out for yourself how you can change the name of the sketch to <em>my_first_sketch</em>.</div>
    </div>

    <p>
        When you create a new program, it looks like this.
    </p>

    <div>
        <pre><code class="language-none">&sol;*

*&sol;

void setup() {
    
}

void loop() {
    
}</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h2 id="toc_5">Comments</h2>

    <p>At the beginning of the program is a <strong>&sol;*</strong> and a <strong>*&sol;</strong>. If the computer runs a program then nothing will be done with what is between <strong>&sol;*</strong> and <strong>*&sol;</strong>, the computer ignores it. You can use this to describe what you do in the program. This way you can add comments or remarks to the program. You can also use it to 'disable' a part of a program. For example;</p>

    <div>
        <pre><code class="language-none">&sol;*        
Here I explain what the program will do.
The program will show a text.
*&sol;

Serial.println("I show this text") ;

&sol;*
Serial.println("This instruction is ignored");
*&sol;
    
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>If you just want to add one line comment or ignore one instruction for a moment, you can also start the line with <strong>&sol;&sol;</strong>. So you often use <strong>&sol;*</strong> and <strong>*&sol;</strong> if you want to ignore multiple lines and <strong>&sol;&sol;</strong> for one line.</p>

    <div>
        <pre><code class="language-none">&sol;*        
 Everything between &sol;* and *&sol; is ignored.
*&sol;

&sol;&sol; But this line also 
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h2 id="toc_6">Functions</h2>

    <p><strong>setup()</strong> and <strong>loop()</strong> are <em>functions</em>. A function is a group of instructions that belong together. The instructions that belong together are between <strong>{</strong> and <strong>}</strong> after the name of the instruction. By calling the function in a program instead of an instruction, you can execute multiple instructions in one time. The function <strong>setup()</strong> is automatically called one time when you start the program. <strong>Loop()</strong> is a function that is executed over and over again.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_7">Your first program</h2>
    <p>Now type the following instructions in the function <strong>setup()</strong>.</p>

    <div>
        <pre><code class="language-none">Serial.begin(9600);
delay(5000);
Serial.println("Hi!");</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>You have now written your first program! But how do you run this program? In order to use a program you need a computer. Because you can't put a whole laptop on a robot we are going to use a very small computer. This computer is called an Arduino Nano. Nano means very small and comes from the Latin word Nanos which means 'dwarf'. Like every computer, the Nano has a processor or CPU, this is the brain of the computer with which it will run your program. There is also a small reset button on it, with which you can restart the Nano if necessary. Because the Nano is so small, you cannot connect a keyboard or monitor to it. You use your computer as a monitor and to send programs to the Nano.</p>

    <img style=" display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;" src="./Student%20guide/Lesson1_Arduino.png" width="600" alt="Arduino Create">




    <div style="overflow: auto;margin: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">
        <img style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;max-width: 350px" src="./Student%20guide/Lesson1_Select_Board.png" alt="Doe" />
        <div>Connect the Nano with a USB cable to your Chromebook. If all goes well you can select the Arduino Nano in the white bar. If you have selected this one, your Chromebook will be connected to the Nano.</div>
    </div>



    <p>Now it's time to start your program. Open your Arduino Create page again and now first left click <strong>Monitor</strong>. To the right of the editor a window will appear. In this window we can show text that the Nano sends to the Chromebook. This is the screen of your Arduino. Now start your first program on the Nano. Do this by 'uploading' the program, sending the program to the Nano. Uploading is done by clicking on the arrow that is shown above the program. Wait a few seconds and if you have done everything right a text will appear in the Nano Monitor.
    </p>

    <img style=" display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; " src="./Student%20guide/Lesson1_create_monitor.png" width=600 alt="" />


    <div style="overflow: auto;margin: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">
        <img style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;" src="./Student%20guide/doe_icoon.png" width=50 alt="Doe" />
        <div>Now adjust the program so that it "Hi, " and then your name on the monitor shows. So for example "Hi, Bert".</div>
    </div>


    <p>The <strong>setup()</strong> function is only called once when the Nano is started. The function <strong>loop()</strong> is called repeatedly till you turn the Arduino off. You will see this if you also send something to the monitor in the function <strong>loop</strong>. For this we use a part of the same instructions as we used in <strong>setup()</strong>. The instruction <code>Serial.begin(9600)</code> may only be used in <strong>setup()</strong>. This instruction ensures that the Arduino connects to the Chromebook. With the instruction <code>delay()</code> you let the program wait a while. Between the round brackets you have to specify how long you want to wait. You have to specify this in milliseconds, thousandths of a second, so if you specify <code>delay(1000)</code> the Nano 1000 * 1&frasl;1000s waits. This is exactly 1 second. With <code>Serial.println()</code> you print a text to the Monitor in Create. What you want to print must always be in double quotes, so &apos; <strong>&quot;</strong> &apos;.</p>

    <div style="overflow: auto;margin: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">
        <img style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;" src="./Student%20guide/doe_icoon.png" width=50 alt="Doe" />
        <div>Now adjust the program so that it shows "One more time!" on the monitor every 5 seconds.</div>
    </div>

    <p>Did you succeed ? Lovely! </p>

    <h2 id="toc_8">Readability</h2>
    <p>As you may have seen, after every instructe there is a ' <strong>;</strong> '. This is for the computer the same as a space that we place between the words in written text. That makes it a piece of readable dontyouagree? So you may place multiple instructions on one line. So for a computer, the left and right examples are evenly as easy to read. To keep a program readable for you and the Nano as well, we agree to start every instruction on a new line and end with a ' ; '</p>

After the M comes a number that indicates the diameter of the screw in millimeters. After the first number comes an 'X' followed by another number. This last number indicates the length of the screw in millimeters. A screw of M3.5x6 has a diameter of 3.5mm and is 6 mm long. In the screw set are M3.5x6, M2.6x4, M1.7x8 and M1.5x4 screws.</td>

    <p>The first step is to mount the stepping motors on the frame. Slide the motors one by one into the frame as shown in the pictures below. Make sure that the blue cap of the motor sticks out above the frame. Then screw the motors in place with 4 M3.5x6 screws.</p>

    <p>Now you are going to screw the breadboard on the frame. Attention! The breadboard has a ridge on one of the long sides. This should point to the front of the robot when screwing it in place. Take a look at the breadboard from the back. Do you see how the holes are connected with each other by the metal strips? </p>

    <p>There is a small switch connected to the battery holder. Push it carefully through the opening marked &quot;ON OFF&quot;. Look carefully at the pictures for the position of the switch when you push it through the opening. The cam of the switch must first pass through the opening. It's a bit of a fiddly job, but with some patience you should succeed. Does a wire break? Don't worry, we can solder it back on. </p>

    <p>Now push the switch from the top into place. The switch must have been turned correctly. If you look at the bottom of the switch you see three connections. On two of these three connections a wire is soldered. The connection without wire should be on the side of the text "OFF ". Now feed the other wires through the hole.</p>

    <p>On the front of the frame, press the reflection sensors one by one with the LEDs carefully into the two holes. Make sure you place the sensor in the right direction. The component side of the circuit board, the side on which the parts are soldered, must face forward. Both holes do not have the same size. The bright LED with the rubber ring should be in the largest hole. If the LEDs are pushed far enough through, then the small rod should stick through the hole of the circuit board. </p>

    <p>Now that the sensors are in place we are going to fix the Darlington drivers. Roll up the wire of the right stepper motor a bit between the four screw holes. Make sure that the connector at the front can protrude a few centimeters as shown in the first picture.</p>
    <p>The Darlington driver still needs electricity to run the motor. In an earlier step you pulled the wires of the battery holder through the hole on the right side of the frame. These are three black (negative) wires and three red (positive) wires. The wires have both male connectors, the connectors with a pin, and female connectors. Now take the longest black and red wire with a female plug. Place these wires under the stepper motor wire in the direction of the switch. Keep a finger on the wires so they stay in place.</p>

        Now you are going to put the wires on the reflection sensors. Start with the right sensor. First make sure you take the right cable, the cable for the sensors are very similar. But if you look closely you can see that the red wire for the right sensor is longer.
    </p>

    <p>Hold the robot frame upside down and look at the text at the pins of the sensor. You can read the labels OUT, GND and VCC. GND means the same as the - of the battery, and VCC means the +. So these pins are for the power to the sensor. With the pin OUT the sensor signals when it detects a line.</p>

    <p>Press the connector so that the red wire is connected to the pin marked VCC and the yellow wire to the pin marked OUT. </p>

    <p>Take a cable tie and use this to fasten the cable as in the pictures below. Do not pull the cable tie too tight otherwise the cable will break.

        <p>Did you succeed? Is the cable properly connected? Nice, repeat this for the left sensor.</p>


        <p>You are now going to connect the sensors, switches and motors which you have attached to the frame to the Arduino. The Arduino has a lot of connections. The pictures below show many different labels for each connection. Each label colour has its own meaning. All you have to do is look at the purple labels. These have a number from 0 to 19. Soon you will have to connect wires to one of these connections. So if the instruction says "Connect the wire to connection 0", then look up the connection with the purple label "0" and connect the wire to it.</p>

        <img style=" display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;width:80% " src="./Student%20guide/ArduinoNanoPinout.png" alt="">

        <p>In addition to the connections with the purple labels, we are going to use three different connections of the Arduino. One of these is the connection with the label &quot;GND&quot;. You have come across this connection before, do you remember what it is for? Another connection is "VIN", here could also have been &quot;VCC&quot;. Do you think you already know where to connect this connection ? Finally the connection is &quot;5V&quot;, this connection always has exactly 5 volts. </p>

        <p>Below you can see how the Nano is fixed on your breadboard. On this breadboard there are many holes. These holes are, as shown on the picture, vertically connected to each other. This means that when you insert wires, as shown in the picture, above and below each other in the holes, they are connected to each other. There is another horizontal interruption in the middle of the breadboard, so that the top and bottom five holes are connected separately.</p>

        <p> On the second picture on the right you see a red and black stripe. These stripes indicate how these pins are connected to each other.</p>

        <p>Below you see what your robot should look like now. You still have a lot of wires that are not connected. We are going to connect these wires step by step to the breadboard so that all parts are connected to the Arduino. The picture shows a label for each wire. These labels will later be used to make clear which wire has to be placed in the breadboard.</p>

        <p>
            <img style=" display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;width:80% " src="./Student%20guide/Lesson2_FrameWired_Labels.JPG" alt="">
        </p>

        <p>We start by connecting the power supply, the electricity, for the sensors and computer. Without power a computer cannot work. Take the <em>VCC BREADBOARD</em> wire and place it in the breadboard so that it is connected to <em>VCC</em> of the Arduino.</p>

        <p>Place the wire <em>GND BREADBOARD</em> and connect it to the <em>GND</em> connection on the Arduino. Look carefully at the pictures and make sure the wires are neat as shown. Soon we will fix the wires so that it doesn't become messy. </p>

        <p>On the Arduino there is a <em>+5V</em> connection. When the Arduino is connected, this connection always produces exactly 5 volts. Because we need to connect more than 4 wires to <em>+5V</em> we will wire this connection to a free row on the breadboard. Take the red short connection wire and connect the <em>+5V</em> of the Arduino with the top left row on the breadboard as shown in the left picture below. You now have 7 instead of 4 connections with <em>+5V</em>. These connections are indicated with a red line on the picture below right.</p>

        <p>We will now repeat what we did for the <em>+5V</em> for the <em>GND</em> connection on the Arduino. Take the short black wire and connect the <em>GND connector on the Arduino with the lower left row on the breadboard. You now have 6 instead of 4 connections with <em>GND</em>. These connections are marked with a black line on the picture below right.</em>

        <p>The reflection sensors need 5 volts to work. In the previous steps you connected <em>GND</em> and <em>5V</em> to the left two rows of the breadboard. Now you are going to connect the sensor to these two rows so the sensor will be powered. Take the black <em>GND SENSOR R</em>wire from the right reflection sensor and place it in one of the holes in the bottom left corner of the breadboard that is connected to <em>GND</em> of the Arduino. Take a good look at the pictures below to see how the wire was laid along the Arduino.</p>

        <p>Both sensors are now connected. Now you connect the power supply to the Darlington drivers so that the two stepper motors can run later. If all goes well two wires of the battery should stick out of the opening of the frame, <em>VCC DARL L</em> and <em>GND DARL L</em>. Take these two wires and place them under the Arduino to the left Darlington driver.</p>

        <p>Connect the wire <em>GND DARL L</em> to the pin with the text '-' and
            <em>VCC DARL L</em> on the '+'.

        <p>Nearly all wires are now in place. The wires of the mode-switch still have to be connected so you can give the robot a command with this switch later on. Take the wire <em>GND MODE SWITCH</em> and place it in one of the last two places on the bottom left side of the breadboard. Then connect the wire <em>SIG MODE SWITCH</em> to connection 0 of the Arduino. Take a good look at the <em>Nano Pinout</em> overview where this connection is located.</p>

        <p>That's it! The wires are still a bit of a mess. We will solve this by securing the wires with the five remaining cable ties. Lay the wires neatly down and then loosely fasten the cable tie. Then place the wires a bit neater and tighten them by tightening the straps. Do not pull the ties too tightly, it is only the intention that the wires stay neatly in place. </p>

        <p>There are also a number of wires at the bottom, you also need to fasten them neatly with the same cable tie. Some cable ties require you to attach wires to the top and bottom of the cable tie. With one of the five cable ties you can't just get the cable tie through the frame. How are you going to solve this? </p>

        <p>The Darlington drivers are connected to the motors, but not yet to the Arduino. Take one of the two Darling driver cables. Connect the side with the pins (male) to the Arduino. For the right motor it must be connected to connections 6 to 9. Connect the other side of the cable to the right Darlington driver. You have to connect the cable to IN1 to IN4. Attention! Connection IN1 must be connected to connection 7 on the Arduino. If you connect it incorrectly, the robot will soon drive in exactly the opposite direction to what you want.</p>

        <h1 id="toc_10">Lesson 3, variables</h1>

        <p>Maybe you've heard of it before, variables. But what are variables actually? A variable in a program is something that can change. A variable in a program always has a type, name and a value.</p>

        <p>It's best to compare a variable with a drawer in a cabinet. You can put something in the drawer and at a later moment see what is in the drawer. You can also take something out of the drawer or replace what is in it with something else. Variables are special drawers that are only suitable for storing one thing of one kind. If you want to store multiple things you need to program multiple drawers. To be able to indicate which drawer you mean in a program, each variable has its own name.</p>

        <p>What kind of things you can store in a variable is indicated by a <em>type</em>. You also don't store your game console in a sockstand and your socks in a kitchen drawer! For now you will use three types of variables; strings, integers and booleans. What are these ?</p>

        <img style=" display: block; float:right; margin-right: auto;width:40% " src="./Student%20guide/letterstring.JPG" alt="">
        <p>A <em>String</em> is daily life is thin thread of rope. A variable of the type <em>String</em> is something like a rope of characters. So it doesn't matter if it's one or a lot of characters as long as they're consecutive. To indicate the beginning and end of a string, you have to put the characters between two double quotes, &quot;. So "This is a String" is a string, and "123 :-)". also. </p>

        <p>If you program a variable you first specify the type of the variable, then the name. By typing a &quot;=&quot; after the name of the variable you can specify what should be stored in the variable. After the <em>=</em> sign you indicate what should be stored into the variable. This is also called assigning a value. In the example below you assign the value <em>Peter</em> to the variable <em>name</em>. This variable is of the type <em>String</em>. With <em>String</em> you can tell that the type of the variable is <em>String</em>.</p>

            <div>The = sign is also called an &quot;operator&quot;. The word operator comes from mathematics and means 'operation'. So an operator makes sure that the value of a variable changes. Other operators are *, +, - etc. </div>
        </div>

        <p>Besides variables of type <em>String</em> you have integers. And integer is a whole number. The numbers 0,1,1,1,2,3,5,8,42,1138 are integers, the number 3,14159265359 are not. Because an integer always has a clear beginning and end, there are no double quotes at the beginning and end of the value. If you do, the computer thinks the value of the type <em>String</em> is.</p>

        <p>With the word <em>int</em> you indicate that the variable is of type <em>integer</em>. This variable can therefore only contain whole numbers.</p>

        <div>
            <pre><code class="language-none">int value = 42 ;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>You can also assign the same value to a variable of the String type.
        </p>

        <div>
            <pre><code class="language-none">String value = "42" ;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            There is only a big difference between the two variables above. The computer can make calculations with the <em>value</em> variable of type <em>int</em>, but because the computer does not recognize the variable <em>value</em> of type <em>String</em> as a number, it cannot make calculations with the variable of type <em>String</em>.</p>

        <p>So the computer can calculate 2 x 21 is.</p>

        <div>
            <pre><code class="language-none">int value = 21 * 2 ;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>But do not calculate what &quot;2 x 21&quot; is. The value of the variable value in the example below is '21 * 2'. It is a String, a thread of, the characters '21 * 2'.</p>
        <div>
            <pre><code class="language-none">String value = "21 * 2" ;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>The last type of variable is <em>boolean</em>. This variable has only two values, true and false. This type will be used a lot, not only in variables but also as a result of equations. If you compare something in a program, for example the value of two variables, the outcome is always true (<em>true</em>) or untrue (<em>false</em>).</p>

        <p>A variable of the boolean type is defined by the word <em>boolean</em>. In the example below, create the <em>trueornot</em> variable of the type <em>boolean</em> and assign the value <em>true</em> (true).</p>
        <div>
            <pre><code class="language-none">boolean trueornot = true ;</code></pre>

        <h2>Smaller and larger than</h2>

        <p>In addition to comparing whether values are equal to each other, you can make more comparisons. You can compare whether one value is larger or smaller than another value. When comparing whether two values are equal, use &quot;==&quot;, to compare whether a value is greater than another value, use the &quot;&gt;&quot;.</p> character.

        <p>The equation gives <em>true</em> (is true) if the number to the left of &gt; is greater than the number to the right. You can remember this more easily by the following memory aid : Left of the &gt; sign is the distance between the lines <em>large</em>, right of the sign is the distance <em>small</em>. The sign can also be seen as an arrow pointing from <em>large</em> to <em>small</em>. If the values match the distance between the lines, the result is <em>true</em></p>.

        <p>In the following program example, the value 7 is shown on the left, the value 3 is shown straight. The arrow points from the <em>largest</em> to the <em>smallest</em> number. The result of this equation is <em>true</em> (1). The content of variable <em>var1</em> is thus <em>larger than</em> the content of variable <em>var2</em></p>.

        <pre><code class="language-none">int var1 = 7 ;
int var1 = 3 ;
    
Serial.println(var1 &gt; var2);</code></pre>

        <p>Besides a <em>larger than</em> comparison there is also a <em>less than</em> comparison. To do this, use the arrow pointing in the other direction to &quot;&lt;&quot;. If in the same program you replace the <em>larger than</em> (&gt;) equation with a <em>less than</em> (&lt;) then the result is <em>false</em> (0). Because, 7 is not less than 3</p>

        <pre><code class="language-none">int var1 = 7 ;
int var1 = 3 ;
    
Serial.println(var1 &lt; var2);</code></pre>


        <h3>Task 4.3</h3>


        <p class="assignment"> Create a new program <em>Lesson_4_largersmaller</em>. In this program, create two variables of the type <em>int</em>. Choose the names of the variables, for example <em>large</em> and <em>small</em>. Make the program compare the variables using the the <em>larger than</em> and <em>less than</em> comparators and show the result on the monitor.</p>.

        <p class="assignment">Try to run the program and see if the results of the equations are correct.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Besides comparing whole numbers with <em>&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;</em>, you can also compare String values. However, this is less obvious. Which word is larger &quot;app&quot; or &quot;apartment&quot;? It is &quot;app&quot; !</p>

        <p>It is strange, or not ? The word &quot;app&quot; is shorter than &quot;apartment&quot;, but when comparing string values, the equation starts with the first character. If this character is equal, the equation continues at the next character. The first two characters of &quot;app&quot; and &quot;apartment&quot; are equal. The third character compares &quot;p&quot; with &quot;a&quot;. The letter &quot;a&quot; occurs earlier in the alphabet and therefore is smaller, just like comparing values where 0 is smaller than 5. When comparing strings, a comparison is made per character from left to right. As soon as there is a difference between the characters, the following characters no longer apply in the equation.</p>

        <p>Below some more examples of comparisons that are true.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-none">app > apartment
primary school landje &gt; landje primary school
A &gt; 1
1 &lt; a
a4 &gt; a3</code></pre>

        <p>You can see that comparing string values is not always very easy to understand. In the further exercises we will not use this kind of comparisons.</p>


        <h2>Less than or equal and greater than or equal</h2>

        <p>You have already learned how to compare whether values are equal, smaller or larger than another value. These equations can also be combined with each other. You can not only compare whether a value is greater than another value, but also greater than or equal to another value. The comparison <code>4 &gt; 3</code> is true, but <code>4 &gt; 4</code> is not. Suppose you want to compare a value that is greater than or equal to 4. Then you can do this very easily by combining the comparison symbols, for example <code>&gt;=</code>. The result of the equation <code>4 &gt;= 4</code> is then true and <code>4 &gt;= 3</code> is also true!</p>

        <p>In addition to the equation greater or equal , <code>&gt;=</code> there is also the equation smaller or equal, <code>&lt;=</code>. Just as with the larger or equal equation, with the smaller or equal equation, both <code>3 &lt;= 4</code> and <code>4 &lt;= 4</code> where.</p>

        <h3>Task 4.4</h3>

        <p class="assignment">Add to the program created in the previous command <em>Lesson_4_largersmaller</em> comparisons using the Less than or equal and greater than or equal equations. </p>

        <p>The last equation is <em>not equal to</em>, <code>!=</code>. The result of this equation is true if both equations are not equal, so <code>3 != 7</code> is true. The exclamation mark for the = sign in the equation means <em>not</em> (NOT) , so it actually says &quot;not equal&quot;.</p>

        <h3>Task 4.5</h3>

        <h1 id="toc_12">Lesson 5, conditional statements</h1>

        <p> You will probably think, nice these comparisons, but what can you actually use those for ? Well you can use them in conditional statements ?! Conditional what ? A statement is another word for a programming instruction, a condition is something that must exist before something else can happen . It becomes a bit clearer with the following example.</p>

        <p>Say that you agree with your friend that you will give him a candy cane if he has helped you with your homework. Then the condition, is that he helped you with your homework. The instruction then is that you give him a candy cane. If you write this down so that it can be understood by a computer, it looks like this.</p>


        <pre><code class="language-none">if (help me with homework) {
  Give my friend a candy cane
}</code></pre>

        <p>You start for a computer with <em>if</em> to indicate that you set a condition that must be met. This condition is between the round brackets and the outcome may only be true or false. The outcome of a condition is therefore a <em>Boolean</em> value. After the condition you place the statements, instructions, that have to be executed if the outcome of the condition, defined between the round brackets, is true. The following example program says <em>if</em> it is true, then show &quot;The condition is true&quot;.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-none">if (true) {
  Serial.println("The condition is true") ;
}</code></pre>

        <p>The boolean value <em>true</em> is true, so if you run the program the text &quot;The condition is true&quot; is shown.</p>

        <h3>Task 5.1</h3>
        <p class="assignment">Create a new program, <em>Lesson_5_condition_if</em>. In the <code>setup()</code> function, create two new variables, <code>large</code> and <code>small</code> of the <em>int</em> type. Fill this variable with a number. The number in variable <code>small</code> must be smaller than in the variable <code>large</code>. Then write an if instruction which prints the text &quot;small is smaller than large&quot; if the value in variable <code>small</code> is smaller than the value in variable <code>large</code>.</p>

        <hr/>

        <p>If all goes well the program of <em>Task 5.1</em> now prints the text "small is smaller than large". But what if the value of small <em>is not</em> smaller than large? So if the outcome condition is <em>false</em>. Then nothing will be printed now! With an if-instruction you can also execute instructions if the outcome of the condition is not true (false). This is done with the word <code>else</code>. You use the word <code>else</code> after the instructions between { and } that is executed if the outcome of the condition is true. After else, use the { and } again to indicate which instructions you want to execute if the outcome of the condition is untrue. Just look at the example below.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-none">if (true) {
  Serial.println("The condition is true") ;
} else {
  Serial.println("The condition is false") ;
}</code></pre>

        <h3>Task 5.2</h3>
        <p class="assignment">Customize the program now <em>Lesson_5_condition_if</em>. Make sure that the text "small is larger than large" is printed if the value in variable <code>small</code> is larger than the value in variable <code>large</code>. Also adjust the value of one of the variables so that the new text is printed.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h1 id="toc_13">Lesson 6, loops</h1>

        <p>Repeatative work is boring! But sometimes useful. Just think about learning the tables. If a computer has to repeat a certain job every time you want to, you can program this more times, for example if you want to print 5x &quot;I repeat this&quot;, you can write it like this.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-none">Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
</code></pre>

        <p>For a few repetitions this is still clear, but suppose you have to repeat something a thousand times. Then the program becomes very long and still does not do much. To make this easier and more convenient there are <em>loop</em>, instructions. Of these, we'll discuss two, the <code>for</code> and the <code>while</code> loop.</p>.

        <h2>The while-loop</h2>

        <p>While means <em>as long as</em>. The instruction <code>while</code> works similarly to the instruction <code>if</code>. If you start with the name of the instruction, <code>while</code>, a condition will appear between two round brackets and instructions between { and }. These last two characters are also called braces. </p>

        <pre><code class="language-none">while (true) {
  Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
}
</code></pre>

        <p>The <code>while</code> instruction repeats the instructions between the braces as long as the outcome of the condition is true.</p>

        <div style="overflow: auto;margin: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">
            <img style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;" src="./Student%20guide/doe_icoon.png" width="50" alt="Doe" />
            <div>Do you know how long the above <code>while</code> loop repeats printing the text?</div>
        </div>

        <p>If you want a <code>while</code> loop to stop repeating at some point, you must make sure that the condition changes from <em>true</em> to <em>false</em> during the repeat. If you don't make sure the outcome of the condition changes, the repeat will never stop.</p>

        <p>Check the example below and try to understand when the <code>while</code> condition changes.</p>


        <pre><code class="language-none">int number = 1 ;
  
while (number &lt; 10) {
  Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
  number = number + 1;
}
  </code></pre>

        <p>The program starts by creating a variable <code>number</code> and assigns it the value &quot;1&quot;. The condition <code>number &lt;= 10</code> in the while-loop then is true. The text &quot;I repeat this&quot; will then be printed. Then the instruction <code>number = number + 1</code> is executed. The variable <em>number</em> will get a new value here. This new value is the current value in variable number, &quot;1&quot;, plus 1. The new content of variable <em>number</em> becomes 2. The result of the while-loop condition is still true, so the instructions between { and } will be repeated again.
        </p>

        <h3>Task 6.1</h3>
        <p class="assignment">Try now to find out how often the text &quot;I repeat this&quot; is printed by the previous example program. Do this by going step-by-step through the program rules and writing down the contents of the variable <em>number</em> and when something is printed.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>The for-loop</h2>

        <p>The for-loop also allows you to repeat multiple instructions. Instead of just a condition, you have to place a <em>initialization</em>, <em>condition</em> and <em>increment</em> between the round brackets in a <code>for-loop</code>. But what are <em>initialization</em>, <em>condition</em> and <em>increment</em>?</p>

        <p>Initialization means creating again, it is creating a variable and assigning an initial value. The instruction <code>int number=1</code> for the while-loop example program showb below is the initialization of the variable <em>number</em></p>.

        <p>You have already dealed with a condition before, this is for example <code>number &lt; 10</code> shown in the while-loop example program below.</p>

        <p>Increment is another word for addition. With this you indicate how much the value of a variable will be increased. In the while-loop example program this is executed in the loop by the instruction <code>number = number + 1</code>.</p>.

        <p>The <em>initialization</em>, <em>condition</em> and <em>increment</em> in a for-loop must appear in parentheses after the instruction <code>for</code>. Between the <em>initialization</em>, <em>condition</em> and <em>increment</em> type a semicolon (;). So it looks like this</p>

        <pre class="assignment"><code class="language-none">for (initialization;condition;increment) {
  // Instructions
}
</code></pre>

        <p>If we want to do exactly the same with a for-loop as in the &quot;I repeat this&quot; while-loop program, the program looks like this.</p>

        <pre class="assignment"><code class="language-none">for (int number=1;number&lt;10;number=number+1) {
  Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
}
</code></pre>

        <p>In a for-loop you actually put all instructions which ensure a good progression of the repetition together. The variable is initialized, <em>number</em> gets the value 1. Each repetition a value of 1 is added to the value of the variable <em>number</em>. And the instructions are repeated as long as the value of the variable <em>number</em> is less than 10.</p>

        <p> If you want to increase the content of a variable by exactly 1, you can also write it down differently. By typing &quot;++&quot; after the name of a variable, for example <code>number+++</code>, this is the same as <code>number = number + 1</code>, so the previous program does exactly the same as the program below.</p>


        <pre class="assignment"><code class="language-none">for (int number=1;number&lt;10;number++) {
  Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
}

        <p class="assignment">This will be a more difficult task, so take your time and think carefully. Write a program that calculates the power of a number. If you want to calculate 2 to the power 4, you calculate the outcome of 2x2x2x2. Two times two is four, four times two is eight and eight times two is sixteen. Two to the power 4 therefore is 16. To calculate a power of a number you need a <em>ground number</em> and a <em>exponent</em>. The base number is the number you want to multiply, the exponent is the number of times you want to multiply the number.</p>

        <p class="assignment">Start the program by creating three variables, <code>ground</code>, <code>exponent</code> and <code>result</code>. Decide for yourself which type of variable you use. Make the content of the variable <code>result</code> equal to the value of <code>ground</code> and choose your own value for the variables <code>ground</code> and <code>exponent</code>. Start with small numbers to keep it comprehensible.</p>

        <p class="assignment"> Then write in a for-loop the calculation of the power of the number in variable <code>ground</code>. Use the variable <code>exponent</code> in the condition. In the for-loop you use a separate variable <code>x</code> for initialization, condition and increment.</p>.

        <p class="assignment">Print the value of variable <code>result</code> after the for-loop is finished. Test your program with base 3 and exponent 5. If the result of the program is 243, then the program works well.</p>

        <h1 id="toc_14">Lesson 7, debugging</h1>


        <p class="assignment">Finding and solving errors in a program is called &quot;debugging&quot;. There are two types of errors in computer programs, syntactic and runtime errors. </p>

        <h2>Syntactic errors</h2>

        <p>What are these for errors ? A syntactic error is something like a speling mistake 😉. So you can already detect syntactic errors before you run a program. If you follow the rules of the programming language exactly, you will never make syntactic errors. But there are a lot of rules. So this is actually a job for a program to track these errors down. This program is also included in your IDE which you can start by clicking the verify button. </p>

        <h3>Task 7.1</h3>

        <p class="assignment">Create a new program in Arduino Create and call it <em>Lesson_7_debugging</em>. Then cut and paste the program below over the current standard program rules. Then find in your Arduino Create ID the verify button. Found it? Click there and see what happens.</p>

        <p>Check the error message in the red bar underneath the program. Do you see what is wrong?</p>
        <hr/>

        <p>If you check the program of <em>Task 7.1</em> for syntactic errors, the IDE indicates <code>expected</code> &apos;;&apos; before &apos;}&apos; token. A <em>token</em> means something like symbol or character. So the IDE expected the character &quot;;&quot; for the character &quot;}&quot;.
        </p>

        <p>But where? Because there are more &quot;}&quot; characters in the program. Under the error message the black box describes the error message in more detail. It is still not easy, but if you often read quietly, it says exactly where the error is located.</p>

        <p>The first red printed line indicates, for example, which function the error is in, <code>In function &apos;void setup()&apos;:</code>. The error is not in the function <code>loop()</code>, but in <code>setup()</code>.</p>.

        <p>The next red printed line shows something that probably looks like <code>Lesson_7_debugging.ino:12:1 error: expected &apos;;&apos; before &apos;}&apos; token</code>. The text <code>12:1</code> indicates exactly where in the program the error is, line 12 and the first character. The IDE therefore despises an &quot;;&quot; for the &quot;}&quot; character.</p>


        <h3>Task 7.2</h3>

        <p class="assignment">Now use the indications in the error messages to solve the error from the program. Where would you put the &quot;;&quot; if you did it properly ?</p>
        <hr/>


        <h2>Runtime errors</h2>

        <p>Runtime errors are errors that occur during the execution of a program. If there is a runtime error in a program, it does not have to occur, but it can sometimes occur. Below you see a program which will have a runtime error when executing it. Start reading the program from the line <code>int number = 5;</code>. The program rules for this line make sure that the program chooses a random number. The <code>random(1,10)</code> function selects a random number from 1 to 10.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-none">void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  delay(2000);
  pinMode(A1,INPUT) ;
  randomSeed(analogRead(A1)); 
  
  int getal = 5;
  Serial.println("start number");
  Serial.println(number);
  
  int counter = random(1, 10);
  Serial.println("start counter");
  Serial.println(counter);
  
  while (number != counter) {
    Serial.println("counter");
    Serial.println(counter);
    counter++ ;
  }
  
  Serial.println("Finished!");
    
}

void loop() {
    
}
    </code>
    </pre>

        <p>First, the variable <code></code> contains the value <em>5</em>. This is then shown in the console of your IDE. Then a random number from 1 to 10 is placed in variable <code>counter</code>. Each time you start the program, a different value will be placed in it.</p>

        <p>After that the program will repeat a number of program lines. The program will repeat these as long as the value of <code>number</code> is not equal to <code>counter</code>. Nothing seems wrong with that, is it not?!</p>

        <h3>Task 7.3</h3>

        <p class="assignment">Create a new program and, and call it <em>Lesson_7_debug_runtime</em>, cut and paste the above program lines into the program. Then hold a finger on the pin <em>A1</em> of the Arduino. It doesn't matter if you touch another pin. Because you make contact with pin <em>A1</em> a very small stream of electricity will flow from the computer to you. How much electricity goes through you varies at each time, this is used by the Arduino to generate a random number.</p>

        <p class="assignment">Then start the program a few times.</p>

        <p class="assignment">You can probably see that the program prints &quot;Finished!&quot; after a few numbers have been printed as shown in the example below.</p>.

        <pre><code class="language-none">start number
5
start counter
2
counter
2
counter
3
counter
4

        <p class="assignment">This is not always the case, if an error runtime error occurs in the program, the counter continues to run.</p>


        <pre><code class="language-none">start number

</code></pre>

        <p class="assignment">How come? Runtime errors are unfortunately not very easy to find. It is important that you work precise and try to debug the program step by step. Do this by going step-by-step through the program rules and writing down what the contents of the variables are and what the outcomes of conditions are.</p>

        <p class="assignment">Below is an example of how to write this down. Besides the contents of the variables is also the line number in the program where the variable changes value or the condition is tested. Now try to understand how the program works by following the steps below. On line 12 the variable <code>counter</code>will get the random number 3. </p>

        <pre><code class="language-none">Step     Line    Number    Counter   Number!=Counter
  1          8        5         -          -
  2         12        5         3          -
  3         16        5         3        True
  4         19        5         4          -
  5         16        5         4        True
  6         19        5         5          -
  7         16        5         5        False  
</code></pre>

        <p class="assignment">Now try to write down the steps yourself as in the example above. Only the variable <code>counter</code>on line 12 gets here the random value 6.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">Step     Line    Number    Counter   Number!=Counter
  1          8        5         -          -
  2         12        5         6          -

        <p class="assignment">As you see something goes wrong here. What do you have to adapt to the program to fix this bug?</p>

        <h1 id="toc_15">Lesson 8, the robot instructionset</h1>

        <p>You can already program and debug now! In the next lessons you will learn more instructions. In addition to the standard C instructions, this robot has special instructions for the robot. These instructions can be found in the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20ENU.html" target="_blank">Landje robot instructionset</a></p>.

        <p>With this special instruction set you can let the robot drive, look, measure distance and recognize lines on the floor. By combining these functions in a program you can, for example, let the robot follow a line on the floor. But you can also let it drive around without bumping into anything.</p>

        <h2>The first robot instruction, move</h2>

        <p>In the next assignment, you will really make the robot move by means of the instruction <code>move</code>. It is an assignment in which you have to read and figure out things out, so take your time.</p>


        <h3>Task 8.1</h3>

        <p class="assignment">Now read the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20ENU.html" target="_blank">Landjerobot instructionset</a> until the paragraph <em>Instructions</em>.</p>

        <p class="assignment">To use the Landjerobot instructions in your program, you must add the instructionset to the library of your IDE. A library is a collection of programs that belong together. For the Landjerobot, the library is named, you will probably guess it, <em>LandjeRobot</em>. Before you can add the library, you must first download it. You can download this library <a href="https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/raw/master/LandjeRobot.zip">here</a></p>.

        <div style="">
            <div style="float:left;width:49%;margin-right: 7px ">
                <p class="assignment">After downloading the library you can add it to your IDE. In your IDE, click in the left column on <em>Libaries</em>. At the top of the second column is now <em>LIBRARY MANAGER</em> with to the right a symbol with an arrow pointing upwards. This is the import button. Click this button to import the just downloaded file <em>LandjeRobot.zip</em>. If this went well you will get a message as shown in the image. </p>
            </div>

            </div>
            <div style="clear:both; "></div>
        </div>

        <p class="assignment">Create a new program <em>Lesson_8_robot_moves</em>. Now use the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20ENU.html" target="_blank">Landjerobot instruction set</a> to write an instruction in the function <code>setup()</code> that will make the robot move 10cm forward. Also don't forget to cut and paste the instructions shown at the top of the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20ENU.html" target="_blank">Landjerobot instructionset</a> into your program. Before sending the program to the robot, make sure you set the ON/OFF switch to <em>OFF</em>.</p>

        <p class="assignment">Do you think the program is fine? Then remove the USB cable from the robot, put 4 batteries in the battery compartment and switch the robot on.</p>

        <hr/>


        <h2>Repeating a move</h2>

        <p>As you have seen, you can use the <code>move</code> instruction to move the robot forward. With another instruction <code>turn</code> you can turn the robot in one direction. How far you turn the robot is indicated in degrees. Take a look in the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20ENU.html" target="_blank">Landje robot instructionset</a> at the instruction <code>turn</code>. At the picture of the robot you see a circle divided into 360 pieces, these pieces are called degrees. If you let the robot rotate 360 degrees, it makes a complete circle. At 90 degrees the robot makes a right angle.</p>

        <p>By using the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> instruction you can make the robot drive a square. If you let the robot move forward first, and then rotate it has covered the first side of a square and is ready for the second side. If you repeat this four times, the robot will drive exactly a perfect square.</p>

        <p>This may be difficult to understand in the beginning. What can help is by replaying the instructions yourself. Print out the image of the robot below, or draw it on a piece of paper. Then cut it out.</p>

        <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;width:40% " src="./Student%20guide/Lesson_8_Robot.png" alt="">

        <p>Now use the instructions below and use your paper robot to execute the instructions. Place the robot on a table and move it according to the instructions. If you follow these instructions, the robot will move into a square and return to the position where it started. </p>

        <pre><code class="language-none">Move 10cm forward
Turn 90 degrees to the left
Move 10cm forward
Turn 90 degrees to the left
Move 10cm forward
Turn 90 degrees to the left
Move 10cm forward
Turn 90 degrees to the left</code></pre>

        <h3>Task 8.2</h3>

        <p class="assignment">You know how to drive the robot in a square and you can program it yourself. The <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> instructions have a different syntax . For example, for the instruction <code>move</code> you have the syntax <code>move( direction , distance) ;</code> and <code>move( direction , distance, waiting) ;</code>. Syntax is how an instruction is composed.</p>

        <p class="assignment">The difference between the two syntaxes is that the first syntax can only specify the direction and distance. With the second syntax you can also indicate that the instruction waits until the action, moving the robot over a distance, is finished. If you don't indicate in the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> instruction that it has to wait until it is finished, the robot will have completed all <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> instructions before the robot has driven an inch!</p>

        <p class="assignment">Now create a new program &quot;Lesson_8_move_square&quot; and program in the function <code>setup()</code> the instructions to move the robot in a square.</p>

        <p class="assignment">If you think the program works properly, upload it to the robot and turn it on. Don't forget to remove the USB cable! </p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>DRY</h2>

        <p>Dry is an abbreviation that every programmer knows. It is the abbreviation of Don't Repeat Yourself. You probably wrote four times the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> instruction in <em>Task 8.2</em>. This is good, but what if you want the robot to drive a 15 centimeter square instead of a 10cm square? Then you have to change the program in 4 places! So it is better to avoid repetitions of instructions in programs. So if you program, DRY!</p>


        <h3>Task 8.3</h3>

        <p class="assignment">Pas het programma van Opdracht 8.2 aan zodat je nog maar &egrave;&egrave;n keer de <code>move</code> en <code>turn</code> instructies gebruikt om de robot in een vierkant te laten bewegen. Heb je even geen idee hoe je dit zou moeten doen, kijk dan eens in hoofdstuk 6, succes!</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>Using sensors</h2>


        <p>Landjerobot has several sensors. Sensors with which you can measure distance, a switch and reflection sensors. These sensors can be used to detect a line on a floor. These sensors work best on a dark floor that has a uniform color. On this floor you will soon stick a piece of white tape so that the sensor can detect it.</p>

        <h3>Task 8.4</h3>

        <p class="assignment">In this command you will adjust the reflection sensors. The sensors give a light that is invisible to humans and then can detect if that light is reflected. You can adjust these sensors to give a signal when a certain amount of light is reflected. So it is best to use the sensor on a dark floor with white tape or a light floor with a dark tape so that the sensor can best detect the difference between floor and tape. You have to adjust the reflection sensors differently when driving on a dark floor than on a light floor. In this task you can find the right steps for your floor to adjust the reflection sensors properly.</p>

        <p class="assignment">Because you will have to turn on the robot to adjust the sensors, it is useful that it does not start to drive at once. So create an empty program in your IDE and upload it to the robot.</p>

        <b class="assignment">light floor</b>

        <p class="assignment">Unplug the USB cable from the robot and turn it on. The reflection sensors have a small blue block with a small screw hole in the middle. Take the smallest Phillips screwdriver (the one in the shape of a cross) and carefully turn the screws of both sensors to the left. Now stick a piece of white tape on the floor and place one of the sensors above the white tape. If all goes well, only one LED on the sensor will be lit. Then slowly turn the screw to the right until a second LED lights up, then stop turning the screw. Repeat the same steps for the other sensor.</p>



        <b class="assignment">dark floor</b>

        <p class="assignment">Unplug the USB cable from the robot and turn it on. The reflection sensors have a small blue block with a small screw hole in the middle. Take the smallest Phillips screwdriver (the one in the shape of a cross) and carefully turn the screws of both sensors to the right. Now stick a piece of black tape on the floor and place one of the sensors above the black tape. If all goes well, only one LED on the sensor will be lit. Then slowly turn the screw to the left until a second LED lights up, then stop turning the screw. Repeat the same steps for the other sensor.</p>

        <p class="assignment">When starting a new program for the robot you always have to copy some lines from the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20ENU.html" target="_blank">Landjerobot instructionset</a>. One of these lines looks like this. </p>

        <pre><code>const bool lineSensorInverse = false ;</code></pre>

        <p class="assignment">If you have a dark floor, you must change this line for every program you create to</p>

        <pre><code>const bool lineSensorInverse = true ;</code></pre>

        <p class="assignment">By changing the value from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code>, the robot knows that you use a dark line on a light floor, instead of a light line on a dark floor.</p>

        <hr/>

        <p>With the instruction <code>detectLine()</code> you can test if the robot detects a line and on which side, the left or right. If you read in the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20ENU.html" target="_blank">Landje robot instructionset</a>, you will see that this instruction can return four different values. Which value is returned, depends on which sensor or sensors detects a line.</p>



        <h3>Task 8.5</h3>

        <p class="assignment">Now write a program that will let the robot drive straight ahead and stop if one of the sensors detects the tape. Start with the instruction <code>move(direction);</code> so that the robot will start driving and does not wait until the instruction is finished. Put this instruction in the <code>setup()</code> function. The <code>setup()</code> is only called once, when you switch the robot on. This will cause the robot to start driving when you turn it on, and it will no longer start driving after it has stopped. Then write in the function <code>loop()</code> your program that makes sure that <em>if</em> the sensor does detect a line it stops the robot.</p>

        <p class="assignment">The <code>detectLine</code> instruction can return four different values <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::NONE</code>, <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::LEFT</code>, <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::RIGHT</code> and <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::BOTH</code>. So the robot must stop if it returns the value <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::LEFT</code>, <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::RIGHT</code> or <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::BOTH</code>. Perhaps you could also write this by using only <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::NONE</code> ? That would make writing the code for stopping the robot much easier! </p>

        <h1 id="toc_16">Les 9, tracking a line</h1>

        <p>In this lesson you will learn to program sensors. With sensors you can observe things, like for example the reflection sensors, the difference between light and dark surfaces on a floor. With the data from this sensor you can then make the robot respond to this.</p>

                <p>By using the reflection sensors you will detect when a sensor passes a line. If it goes over a line you will have to do something to make sure the robot will follow the line again. </p>

                <p>In the example on the right, if the robot continues to drive straight ahead, it will not cross the line with the reflection sensors at all. You don't have to adjust the robot to let it follow the line. </p>

        <h3>Task 9.1</h3>

        <p class="assignment">Now stick pieces of tape on the floor of about 1 meter that the robot has to follow. Make a few bends here and there, as shown in the pictures above. Do not make them too sharp otherwise the other sensor will detect the line during the rotation of the robot and the robot can get stuck.
        </p>

        <p class="assignment">Now create a new program in Arduino Create. Give the program the name &quot;My_Robot&quot;. In the following tasks you will expand this program further and further. Now program the robot to follow the line. In short you must make the robot:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Start driving in the function <code>setup()</code> function when you turn the robot on</li>
            <li>When the robot is moving, it must do the following in the function <code>loop()</code> </li>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a line is detected on the left, rotate 10 degrees to the left.</li>
                    <li>If a line is detected on the right, rotate 10 degrees to the right.</li>
                    <li>After making a turn continue driving again</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="assignment">In this task it is the first time you will use the <code>turn</code> instruction. Find in the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20ENU.html" target="_blank">Landje robot instructionset</a> how to use the instruction. Think carefully whether you let the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> instruction wait till it is completed and continue with the next instruction.</p>

        <p class="assignment">Do you think the program is fine? Then test it out! If the program does not do what you expect of it, try to debug what goes wrong. It helps if you try to replay the program with the &quot;paper robot&quot;.</p>

        <h3>Task 9.3</h3>

        <p class="assignment">Stick the turn lines with tape at the beginning and end of the line the robot should follow. Make the lines wide enough, about as wide as the wheels of the robot are apart. Make the turn lines twice as thick by sticking two strips of tape next to each other.
        </p>

        <p class="assignment">Because you probably created your own solution in assignment 9.1, you will continue with the solution as shown below. Copy the solution below for command 9.1 into your program, &quot;My_Robot&quot;. There are also some comments explaining what the instructions do. So try to understand this program before you continue.</p>

        <pre><code>void setup() {

        <p class="assignment">Expand your program now. Make sure the robot turns around at a &quot;full turn line&quot;. When it is turned around, the robot should follow the line again in the other direction, and then turn around at the next &quot;full turn line&quot; again.</p>

        <p class="assignment">The robot must turn when both the left and right reflection sensors do detect a line. To program this you can use the existing program lines rotating the robot to the left and right as an example.</p>

        <p class="assignment">Then you have to make sure that the robot does not wobble before the &quot;full turn line&quot;. Program what you came up with in task 9.2 to make the robot turn properly and try if it works. Can you not get it to work? Then try to debug what goes wrong. It helps if you go through the program step by step again with your paper robot.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>The mode switch</h2>

        <p>You now have a program ready that makes sure the robot drives along a line and turns on a &quot;full turn line&quot;. Later you'll program the robot to drive around and avoid other robots and objects. It would be useful if you can save both programs into the robots memory and decide which program to execute when you switch the robot on.</p>

        <p>For this you need something to be able to pass your choice on to the robot. You can do this without having to connect the robot to a computer again with the mode switch. This switch has two positions, 1 and 2. By means of the instruction <code>mode</code> you can determine which position the switch is in.</p>

        <h3>Task 9.4</h3>

        <p class="assignment">In this task you will make sure that the robot only starts your &quot;line follow&quot; program in, &quot;My_Robot&quot;, when the mode switch is set to &quot;1&quot;. If the switch is set to &quot;2&quot;, the robot is not allowed to do anything. Later you will make sure that another program is started in position 2.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Read how the instruction <code>mode</code> works in the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20ENU.html" target="_blank">Landje robot instructionset</a></li>
            <li>Place a variable <code>mode</code> of the type <code>int</code> before the function <code>setup()</code> and give it the value <code>0</code>. If you create a variable in a function, you can only use it in this function. For example, if you create the variable <code>mode</code> in the <code>setup()</code> function, you cannot use it in the <code>loop()</code> function. The function <code>loop()</code> then does not know this variable. If you create a variable before the function <code>setup()</code> and <code>loop()</code> you can use it in both functions.
            </li>
            <li>In the function <code>setup()</code> , write a piece of program that causes the variable <code>mode</code> to get the value from the instruction <code>mode</code>.</li>
            <li>In the function <code>setup()</code>, let the robot only start driving if the variable <code>mode</code> has the value &quot;1&quot;</li>
            <li>Adjust the <code>loop</code> function in your program so that the instructions as you completed in task 9.3 will only be executed if the switch is in position 1 when starting the robot.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If all went well, you'll have the first program of the robot ready now! Test the program now.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Switch the robot off and set the mode switch to "1".</li>
            <li>Place the robot on the line and turn it on. The robot should now follow the line and turn around at the double line.</li>
            <li>Switch the robot off and set the mode switch to "2".</li>
            <li>Place the robot on the line and turn it on. If all goes well, the robot will do nothing.</li>

        <h2>Placing the robot's head</h2>

        <p>In the head of the robot of the robot are an ultrasonic sensor and a led. The ultrasonic sensor can measure distance with a sound that is not audible to us. It measures a distance by making a sound and waiting until the echo of this sound comes back. By means of the time that lies between the sending and receiving of the sound, the computer can calculate the distance. The led in the robot's mouth can blink so it looks like it's talking. You can also turn the led on or off and detect if it is flashing.</p>

        <p>The head of the robot comes on a motor. This is not just a motor, but a servo motor. A servo motor can't rotate continously. This motor can turn the shaft exactly half a circle, 180 degrees, to the left <em>and</em> to the right. Because the motor knows exactly in which position the shaft is, you can indicate how many degrees it should move to the left or right.</p>

        <p>Later on you can use the instruction <code>look</code> to steer the direction of the axis. The axis can then be rotated 45 and 90 degrees to the left and right and positioned exactly in the middle. By rotating this axis you can later, after securing the robot's head, make it look to the left and right.</p>

        <p>Now it is so handy that you know in which position the motor is <em>before</em> you screw the head onto the servo motor. Otherwise there is a good chance that the robot always looks in another directon than you want it to look. Therefore, first make sure that the shaft of the servo motor is exactly in the middle before you attach the head of the robot.</p>

        <h3>Task 10.1</h3>

You are now going to write a new temporary program that you will only use for the correct setup of the servo-motor.</p>

        <h2>Let the robot 'talk' and 'look'.</h2>

        <p>The robot now has a mouth with which it can 'talk' and a pair of eyes with which it can really look. In the following assignments you will learn how to let the robot look and talk.</p>

        <h3>Task 10.2</h3>

        <p class="assignment">When you have connected the head of the robot, the robot is complete. On the head of the robot are the ultrasonic sensor with which you can measure distances. There is also a led in the mouth that you can turn on, off and blink. You can turn the LED on or off. You can also make it blink for a few seconds. Search in the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20ENU.html" target="_blank">Landje robot instructionset</a> the instructions you need for this. Create a new program, &quot;Lesson_10_mouth&quot; and try out these three instructions. For example, write instructions that illuminate the led, turn it off and make it blink. Between these instructions you can use the <code>delay()</code> instruction to wait a while between the instructions.</p>

                <p>In the head of the robot is an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances, but how does it actually work? When the sensor starts measuring the distance, it makes a sound. This sound is a high beep that we humans cannot hear. This sound goes in the direction where the sensor is pointing. When the sound comes something on its way, the sound is reflected and comes back to the sensor. The reflection of sound is called 'echo'. Once the sensor has received the sent sound again, it measures how long the sound has been on its way from the sensor to the object and back again.</p>

                <p>Sound moves at a speed of about 343 meters per second or over 1200 km/h! Because we know how fast sound moves, we can use the measured time to calculate the distance between the sensor and the object.

                    <p class="assignment">In this command you will have the robot measure distance using the ultrasonic sensor. Create a new program in the Arduino Web editor, <em>Lesson_10_measure_distance</em></p>.

                    <p>To make it a bit easier you get the program below. Cut and paste this program in the new programs <em>Lesson_10_measure_distance</em> function <code>setup()</code>. Then replace the 3 places with <em>...</em> with the correct instructions </p>.

                    <p>Test the program by starting the program and opening the monitor in the Ardunio Web editor. Now move your hand very slowly towards the sensor. If all goes well, the robot will start 'talking' if you are less than 5 cm from the sensor.</p>

                <p>In the previous lessons you wrote the first program for the robot. This program allowed the robot to follow a line and reverse at the end of a line. You started this program by making sure that the <em>mode</em> switch was set to "<em>1</em>" when you turned on the robot.</p>

                <p>In the next lessons you will expand the program. This extension of the program will be started when the <em>mode</em> switch is set to "<em>2</em>" when the robot is switched on.</p>

                <p>Instead of following a line, you will now move the robot within an area. This area is created by marking the outside with tape on the floor, just like on the example on the left. If the robot detects a line while driving, the robot has to turn and move on within the area.
                </p>

                <p>In addition, you are going to use the robot's eyes, as it can now see whether there is anything that needs to be driven around.</p>

                <h3>Task 11.1</h3>
                <p class="assignment">It's time to use your paper robot again! Take a sheet of paper and draw a rectangle with a thick marker as shown in the image on the right. Place your paper robot in the rectangle and drive with it.</p>

                <p class="assignment"> Now look at how many ways the reflection sensors of the robot can touch the lines. Describe per way what the robot has to do to stay within the lines. Write this down as follows; &quot;<b>If the [left | right | both] sensor detects the line,  then ... and then  ...  </b>&quot;. </p>

        <p>In task 11.1 you have now thought about what the robot has to do to stay neatly within the lines on the floor. The program rules you are going to write to do this have to be repeated as long as the robot is moving. These program rules have to be placed in the function <code>loop()</code>. Only something is needed in the function <code>setup()</code> to get the robot to start properly.</p>


        <h3>Task 11.2</h3>
        <p class="assignment">Pack the roll of tape and use it to make a rectangle on the floor. Make the rectangle big enough for the robot to drive around in it. But don't make it so big that it takes a long time before the robot touches a line. Later in the lessons you will be allowed to make a much larger rectangle. Now a length of one to one and a half meter per side of the rectangle is very nice.</p>

        <p class="assignment">Are the lines tape nicely? Then you can try out the robot. Put the robot in the middle of the rectangle and set the <em>mode</em> switch to position <em>2</em>. Then turn on the robot, and what happens ?</p>

        <p class="assignment">Yes, something is missing. The robot should do one thing as soon as you turn it on! Open the program &quot;My_Robot&quot; and adjust the function <code>setup()</code> so that the robot does what it should do after you turn it on! You don't know what the robot should do ? Then set the <em>mode</em> switch to <em>1</em> and turn on the robot. Now you know!</p>
        <hr/>

        <p>yeah now, the robot will move if you set the <em>mode</em> switch to <em>2</em>, but it will not stay neatly within the lines! You'll solve that in the next command.</p>

        <h3>Task 11.3</h3>

        <p class="assignment">Now program the instructions you worked out with the paper robot so that the robot stays within the lines. What does the robot have to do to stay within the lines?
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>If no line is detected, all the robot needs to do is to (keep!) driving.</li>
            <li>If a line is detected on the left side, the robot must be able to
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>drive backwards,</li>
                        <li>turn to the right,</li>
                        <li>and drive on again</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If a line is detected on the right side, the robot must be able to
                    <li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>drive backwards,</li>
                            <li>turn to the left,</li>
                            <li>and drive on again</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If a line is detected to the left and right, the robot must be able to
                        <li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>drive backwards,</li>
                                <li>turn around,</li>
                                <li>and drive on again</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

        </ul>

        <p>Tip: Look again at the program rules you wrote for following the line! </p>

        <p class="assignment">If you think the program is ok, send it to the robot, set the mode switch to <em>2</em> and turn it on. If something goes wrong, check what goes wrong and try to fix the error in the program. If you don't understand it at all, try to solve one problem at a time. For example, if the robot doesn't do what you want when touching the line with the left sensor, place the robot in a position that it always touches the left line first. Sometimes it also helps to set program rules <em>off</em>. You can easily disable program lines by typing <code>//</code> at the beginning of the line. The robot will then know that it should not execute these lines.</p>
        <hr/>

        <p>You've come a long way now ! The robot stays within the lines and drives around independently. Only when there is something else within the lines, the robot drives against it because it can't see anything yet. Now you are going to program this in the next steps. We start simply and then we will make it a bit more difficult.</p>

        <h3>Task 11.4</h3>

        <p class="assignment">As said before, we start simply. Have you noticed that the robot looks in a different direction every time you turn it on? You never know which way the robot is looking when you turn it on. If you don't know which way the robot is looking, you won't know whether the robot is measuring the distance to the left, front or right of the robot.
        </p>

        <p class="assignment">Now expand your program &quot;My_Robot&quot; so that the head of the robot always points forward when you turn it on.</p>
        <hr/>

        <p>Now that you know that the robot always starts looking ahead, measuring the distance from the front of the robot becomes a lot easier. By measuring the distance to an object in front of you while driving the robot, you can make sure that the robot does not drive into the area of the robot against other things. </p>

        <h3>Task 11.5</h3>

        <p class="assignment">In this command you will try to make the robot stop as soon as something is in the way. Let the robot stop well in time, so stop if the robot sees something that is 10 centimeters or less in front of the robot.
        </p>

        <p class="assignment">Start by measuring the distance. Create a variable <code>distance</code> and fill it with the measured distance. Pay attention where you are going to place this line in your program. You have to measure the distance all the time the robot is moving. It is not necessary, or even better not, to measure the distance when the robot detects a line. Do you also know why it is better not to measure the distance when the robot detects a line? </p>

        <p class="assignment">Add now the program rules that cause the robot to stop if the distance between the robot and an object is less than 10cm.</p>

                <p>Your robot now stands still when something is on its way, but what to do? What should the robot do ?</p>?

                <p>You can let the robot turn around and drive on. But it can also be smarter, you can also let the robot drive around the obstacle, so it can continue its way.</p>

                <p>But how can you best let the robot drive around an obstacle? Look at the picture on the right. On this drawing three lines are drawn. Each line points in a different direction, left, forward and right. Each line shows the distance of the robot from the obstacle.</p>

                <h3>Task 11.6</h3>
                <p class="assignment">If the robot now has to drive around the obstacle, which direction would you steer it?</p>

                <p class="assignment">The robot can turn its head and measure the distance between the robot and an object with its eyes. If you now measure the distance of the robot left, forward and right and compare these distances. To which side should the robot drive the shortest, middle or longest measured distance ? </p>

                <p class="assignment"> Your robot can now drive around within the lines and stop when it sees something 10cm in front of it. Time to expand the program &quot;My_Robot&quot; again. The robot now has to decide which way to go in order to drive around the objectit detects in front of it.</p>

                <p class="assignment">Extend the program after the instruction line <code>landjerobot.move(LandjeRobot::DIRECTION::STOP) ;</code> when the distance between the robot and the object is measured to be less than 10cm. Now make sure the robot measures the distance to the left and right. Compare these two distances and make sure that the robot now turns in the right direction so that it drives around the object.</p>

                <p class="assignment">Tip: The robot measures the distance better if you wait a while after turning the head, 1 second is more than enough, before you measure the distance.
                </p>

                <p class="assignment">Time to test ! Put your robot down, set it with the switch to mode &quot;2&quot; and let it drive within the lines. Now take an object and place it far enough in front of the robot. If he drives around it, you've succeeded!

        <h1 id="toc_19">Lesson 12, Improving your program</h1>

        <p>You robot can now drive around independently. But as you probably already noticed, things are not always going well. Sometimes it still touches the object that is in the way or the robot tries to push it aside. It can even happen that it drives over the lines and leaves the area to explore the rest of the space.</p>

        <p>In this last lesson there are four more tasks that you have to perform independently. </p>

        <h3>Task 12.1</h3>
        <p class="assignment">Sometimes if the robot has to rotate just in front of an object, it may be that it has too little space when making turns and pushes the object aside. How can you prevent this? Adjust the program so that it doesn't touch any more objects during rotation. You have no idea how to solve this problem ? Then grab your paper robot, draw an obstacle on a sheet of paper and drive it to the obstacle. Let your robot rotate at the obstacle and see if you can see what to do to avoid hitting the obstacle.</p>
        <hr/>

        <h3>Task 12.2</h3>
        <p class="assignment">It's never nice when you have to stop again and drive around something. This robot doesn't like this either, let the robot grumble when something is in front of it by make it talk for 5 seconds!</p>
        <hr/>

        <h3>Task 12.3</h3>
        <p class="assignment">Even if there is nothing in the way of the robot it something sees an object in front of it and then goes in a different direction. This may occur due to measurement errors of the robot. This can be due to echo of the sound of the sensor that is being detected or by sound from another robots sensor. You can make the robot look better to detect object more reliably. If the robot thinks there is something in front of him, let it measure 5 times in a row. Add up the measured distances. If the accumulated measurements are less than 5 times the distance the robot should stop at, the robot has certainly seen well.</p>
        <hr/>

        <h3>Task 12.4</h3>
        <p class="assignment">It may be that if something is right in front of a robot there is even less distance left and right. The robot can then not drive around it. Make a solution for this and test it out.</p>
