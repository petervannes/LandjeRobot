    <p>You can read a lot about programming. But you learn it mainly by doing yourself, making mistakes and solving those yourself. Searching for and solving errors yourself is called debugging.</p>

    <p><strong>Why is searching for and troubleshooting errors called debugging?</strong> A &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is a little, beetle or insect. Long ago computers consisted of electric switches. Between these switches, a beetle or fly could get stuck and blocking the switch. Because of the stuck switch, the computer no longer worked properly. To make the computer work properly again, the bug, beetle or fly had to be found and removed to make it work properly again. The syllable &quot;de&quot; in debugging means undo or remove. So debugging literally means removing an insect and comes from the first program error ever found.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_1">Landje Robot</h2>

    <p>So you're going to try a lot yourself, puzzle and learn from your own mistakes! You will do this with a robot, Landje Robot. Landje Robot is capable of the following things if you program it well;</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Driving around</li>
        <li>Follow lines</li>
        <li>Stay within a line marked area</li>
        <li>Measure distance to another object</li>
        <li>Dodge other objects or robots</li>
        <li>Flashing a light.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2 id="toc_2">Programming language</h2>

    <p>To program you use a language. A language that your computer understands so you can explain what it should do. There are many languages, some languages are very suitable for writing games, others are better equipped to make complex calculations. If you start with programming there is a good chance that you do this in Scratch. With Scratch, you can make a program by sliding blocks together. </p>

    <p><img src="./Student%20guide/Scratch_Hello_World.png" alt="Scratch Hello World" /><br>A simple example of a program in Scratch.</p>

    <p>Hardly any programming language works like Scratch. Most programming languages require you to write a command to let the computer know what to do. Writing a program is more difficult than programming with Scratch. This is because a computer is very precise and very stupid (really!). A computer only understands you if you tell it exactly what you want. </p>

    <div>
        <pre><code class="language-none">// This is understood by the computer
Serial.println(&quot;Hi&quot;) ;

// This the computer does not understand
Serial.Println(&quot;Hi&quot;) ;</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Do you see the difference between the two instructions ?</p>

    <p>Programming Landje Robot will be done in the programming language C (<em>see</em>). As you could see in the previous example, English words are used here.</p>

    <h1 id="toc_3">Lesson 1, Your first program</h1>

    <h2 id="toc_4">Arduino Create</h2>

    <p>In this lesson you will write the first program. Programs can be written in many ways, but usually you do this with a program that helps you with writing programs. Such a program is called an Integrated Development Environment. A mouthful, that's why everyone is talking about an IDE. The IDE you are going to use is &lsquo; in the cloud &rsquo;. You must have heard this term before. It means nothing but that you can use the program anywhere in the world if you only have an internet connection and a computer.</p>

    <p>You will use the IDE Arduino Create. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Start <em>Chrome</em> and go to the internet page <a href="https://create.arduino.cc">https://create.arduino.cc</a>.</li>
        <li>Click the <em>Arduino Web Editor</em> button to start the IDE.</li>
        <li>You are now on the login page but do not have a valid username and account yet. </li>
        <li>Click now under <em>create a new account</em> on the button <em>sign up</em>.</li>
        <li>Think up a username and password. Make sure you write down the username somewhere. Make up a password that <strong>You</strong> can easily remember, but is not easily guessed by anyone else. </li>
        <li>Enter your e-mail address.
            <li>To create your account you must prove that you are not a robot. Read the command carefully and execute it. If you do this correctly enough you will have shown that you are not a robot and your account will be created.</li>
            <li>To log in you must prove that the e-mail address is really yours. Look in your mail and click on the link you received from Arduino.</li>
            <li>Succeeded ? Then try logging in now. If this went well the screen will look like the picture below.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img style=" display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;" src="./Student%20guide/create.arduino.cc.png" width="600" alt="Arduino Create"></p>

    <p>To start the IDE click on the button <em>Arduino Web Editor</em>. In the IDE you can click on various tabs on the left. Click on <em>Sketchbook</em>. A program in this IDE is called a <em>sketch</em>. To the right of the <em>Sketchbook</em> you will see sketches that you have saved in the book.</p>

    <p><img style=" display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;" src="./Student%20guide/editor.arduino.png" width="600" alt="Arduino Create"></p>

    <p>Now create a new sketch by clicking <em>NEW SKETCH</em>. A new sketch automatically gets a name like &lsquo;sketch_jan11b&rsquo;. This is often not useful, it would be clearer if the sketch is called <em>my first sketch</em>. </p>

    <div style="overflow: auto;margin: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">
        <img style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;" src="./Student%20guide/doe_icoon.png" width="50" alt="Doe" />
        <div>Try to figure out for yourself how you can change the name of the sketch to <em>my_first_sketch</em>.</div>
    </div>

    <p>
        When you create a new program, it looks like this.
    </p>

    <div>
        <pre><code class="language-none">&sol;*

*&sol;

void setup() {
    
}

void loop() {
    
}</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h2 id="toc_5">Comments</h2>

    <p>At the beginning of the program is a <strong>&sol;*</strong> and a <strong>*&sol;</strong>. If the computer runs a program then nothing will be done with what is between <strong>&sol;*</strong> and <strong>*&sol;</strong>, the computer ignores it. You can use this to describe what you do in the program. This way you can add comments or remarks to the program. You can also use it to 'disable' a part of a program. For example;</p>

    <div>
        <pre><code class="language-none">&sol;*        
Here I explain what the program will do.
The program will show a text.
*&sol;

Serial.println("I show this text") ;

&sol;*
Serial.println("This instruction is ignored");
*&sol;
    
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>If you just want to add one line comment or ignore one instruction for a moment, you can also start the line with <strong>&sol;&sol;</strong>. So you often use <strong>&sol;*</strong> and <strong>*&sol;</strong> if you want to ignore multiple lines and <strong>&sol;&sol;</strong> for one line.</p>

    <div>
        <pre><code class="language-none">&sol;*        
 Everything between &sol;* and *&sol; is ignored.
*&sol;

&sol;&sol; But this line also 
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h2 id="toc_6">Functions</h2>

    <p><strong>setup()</strong> and <strong>loop()</strong> are <em>functions</em>. A function is a group of instructions that belong together. The instructions that belong together are between <strong>{</strong> and <strong>}</strong> after the name of the instruction. By calling the function in a program instead of an instruction, you can execute multiple instructions in one time. The function <strong>setup()</strong> is automatically called one time when you start the program. <strong>Loop()</strong> is a function that is executed over and over again.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_7">Your first program</h2>
    <p>Now type the following instructions in the function <strong>setup()</strong>.</p>

    <div>
        <pre><code class="language-none">Serial.begin(9600);
delay(5000);
Serial.println("Hi!");</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>You have now written your first program! But how do you run this program? In order to use a program you need a computer. Because you can't put a whole laptop on a robot we are going to use a very small computer. This computer is called an Arduino Nano. Nano means very small and comes from the Latin word Nanos which means 'dwarf'. Like every computer, the Nano has a processor or CPU, this is the brain of the computer with which it will run your program. There is also a small reset button on it, with which you can restart the Nano if necessary. Because the Nano is so small, you cannot connect a keyboard or monitor to it. You use your computer as a monitor and to send programs to the Nano.</p>

    <img style=" display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;" src="./Student%20guide/Lesson1_Arduino.png" width="600" alt="Arduino Create">




    <div style="overflow: auto;margin: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">
        <img style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;max-width: 350px" src="./Student%20guide/Lesson1_Select_Board.png" alt="Doe" />
        <div>Connect the Nano with a USB cable to your Chromebook. If all goes well you can select the Arduino Nano in the white bar. If you have selected this one, your Chromebook will be connected to the Nano.</div>
    </div>



    <p>Now it's time to start your program. Open your Arduino Create page again and now first left click <strong>Monitor</strong>. To the right of the editor a window will appear. In this window we can show text that the Nano sends to the Chromebook. This is the screen of your Arduino. Now start your first program on the Nano. Do this by 'uploading' the program, sending the program to the Nano. Uploading is done by clicking on the arrow that is shown above the program. Wait a few seconds and if you have done everything right a text will appear in the Nano Monitor.
    </p>

    <img style=" display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; " src="./Student%20guide/Lesson1_create_monitor.png" width=600 alt="" />


    <div style="overflow: auto;margin: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">
        <img style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;" src="./Student%20guide/doe_icoon.png" width=50 alt="Doe" />
        <div>Now adjust the program so that it "Hi, " and then your name on the monitor shows. So for example "Hi, Bert".</div>
    </div>


    <p>The <strong>setup()</strong> function is only called once when the Nano is started. The function <strong>loop()</strong> is called repeatedly till you turn the Arduino off. You will see this if you also send something to the monitor in the function <strong>loop</strong>. For this we use a part of the same instructions as we used in <strong>setup()</strong>. The instruction <code>Serial.begin(9600)</code> may only be used in <strong>setup()</strong>. This instruction ensures that the Arduino connects to the Chromebook. With the instruction <code>delay()</code> you let the program wait a while. Between the round brackets you have to specify how long you want to wait. You have to specify this in milliseconds, thousandths of a second, so if you specify <code>delay(1000)</code> the Nano 1000 * 1&frasl;1000s waits. This is exactly 1 second. With <code>Serial.println()</code> you print a text to the Monitor in Create. What you want to print must always be in double quotes, so &apos; <strong>&quot;</strong> &apos;.</p>

    <div style="overflow: auto;margin: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">
        <img style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;" src="./Student%20guide/doe_icoon.png" width=50 alt="Doe" />
        <div>Now adjust the program so that it shows "One more time!" on the monitor every 5 seconds.</div>
    </div>

    <p>Did you succeed ? Lovely! </p>

    <h2 id="toc_8">Readability</h2>
    <p>As you may have seen, after every instructe there is a ' <strong>;</strong> '. This is for the computer the same as a space that we place between the words in written text. That makes it a piece of readable dontyouagree? So you may place multiple instructions on one line. So for a computer, the left and right examples are evenly as easy to read. To keep a program readable for you and the Nano as well, we agree to start every instruction on a new line and end with a ' ; '</p>

After the M comes a number that indicates the diameter of the screw in millimeters. After the first number comes an 'X' followed by another number. This last number indicates the length of the screw in millimeters. A screw of M3.5x6 has a diameter of 3.5mm and is 6 mm long. In the screw set are M3.5x6, M2.6x4, M1.7x8 and M1.5x4 screws.</td>

    <p>The first step is to mount the stepping motors on the frame. Slide the motors one by one into the frame as shown in the pictures below. Make sure that the blue cap of the motor sticks out above the frame. Then screw the motors in place with 4 M3.5x6 screws.</p>

    <p>Now you are going to screw the breadboard on the frame. Attention! The breadboard has a ridge on one of the long sides. This should point to the front of the robot when screwing it in place. Take a look at the breadboard from the back. Do you see how the holes are connected with each other by the metal strips? </p>

    <p>There is a small switch connected to the battery holder. Push it carefully through the opening marked &quot;ON OFF&quot;. Look carefully at the pictures for the position of the switch when you push it through the opening. The cam of the switch must first pass through the opening. It's a bit of a fiddly job, but with some patience you should succeed. Does a wire break? Don't worry, we can solder it back on. </p>

    <p>Now push the switch from the top into place. The switch must have been turned correctly. If you look at the bottom of the switch you see three connections. On two of these three connections a wire is soldered. The connection without wire should be on the side of the text "OFF ". Now feed the other wires through the hole.</p>

    <p>On the front of the frame, press the reflection sensors one by one with the LEDs carefully into the two holes. Make sure you place the sensor in the right direction. The component side of the circuit board, the side on which the parts are soldered, must face forward. Both holes do not have the same size. The bright LED with the rubber ring should be in the largest hole. If the LEDs are pushed far enough through, then the small rod should stick through the hole of the circuit board. </p>

    <p>Now that the sensors are in place we are going to fix the Darlington drivers. Roll up the wire of the right stepper motor a bit between the four screw holes. Make sure that the connector at the front can protrude a few centimeters as shown in the first picture.</p>
    <p>The Darlington driver still needs electricity to run the motor. In an earlier step you pulled the wires of the battery holder through the hole on the right side of the frame. These are three black (negative) wires and three red (positive) wires. The wires have both male connectors, the connectors with a pin, and female connectors. Now take the longest black and red wire with a female plug. Place these wires under the stepper motor wire in the direction of the switch. Keep a finger on the wires so they stay in place.</p>

        Now you are going to put the wires on the reflection sensors. Start with the right sensor. First make sure you take the right cable, the cable for the sensors are very similar. But if you look closely you can see that the red wire for the right sensor is longer.
    </p>

    <p>Hold the robot frame upside down and look at the text at the pins of the sensor. You can read the labels OUT, GND and VCC. GND means the same as the - of the battery, and VCC means the +. So these pins are for the power to the sensor. With the pin OUT the sensor signals when it detects a line.</p>

    <p>Press the connector so that the red wire is connected to the pin marked VCC and the yellow wire to the pin marked OUT. </p>

    <p>Take a cable tie and use this to fasten the cable as in the pictures below. Do not pull the cable tie too tight otherwise the cable will break.

        <p>Did you succeed? Is the cable properly connected? Nice, repeat this for the left sensor.</p>


        <p>You are now going to connect the sensors, switches and motors which you have attached to the frame to the Arduino. The Arduino has a lot of connections. The pictures below show many different labels for each connection. Each label colour has its own meaning. All you have to do is look at the purple labels. These have a number from 0 to 19. Soon you will have to connect wires to one of these connections. So if the instruction says "Connect the wire to connection 0", then look up the connection with the purple label "0" and connect the wire to it.</p>

        <img style=" display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;width:80% " src="./Student%20guide/ArduinoNanoPinout.png" alt="">

        <p>In addition to the connections with the purple labels, we are going to use three different connections of the Arduino. One of these is the connection with the label &quot;GND&quot;. You have come across this connection before, do you remember what it is for? Another connection is "VIN", here could also have been &quot;VCC&quot;. Do you think you already know where to connect this connection ? Finally the connection is &quot;5V&quot;, this connection always has exactly 5 volts. </p>

        <p>Below you can see how the Nano is fixed on your breadboard. On this breadboard there are many holes. These holes are, as shown on the picture, vertically connected to each other. This means that when you insert wires, as shown in the picture, above and below each other in the holes, they are connected to each other. There is another horizontal interruption in the middle of the breadboard, so that the top and bottom five holes are connected separately.</p>

        <p> On the second picture on the right you see a red and black stripe. These stripes indicate how these pins are connected to each other.</p>

        <p>Below you see what your robot should look like now. You still have a lot of wires that are not connected. We are going to connect these wires step by step to the breadboard so that all parts are connected to the Arduino. The picture shows a label for each wire. These labels will later be used to make clear which wire has to be placed in the breadboard.</p>

        <p>
            <img style=" display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;width:80% " src="./Student%20guide/Lesson2_FrameWired_Labels.JPG" alt="">
        </p>

        <p>We start by connecting the power supply, the electricity, for the sensors and computer. Without power a computer cannot work. Take the <em>VCC BREADBOARD</em> wire and place it in the breadboard so that it is connected to <em>VCC</em> of the Arduino.</p>

        <p>Place the wire <em>GND BREADBOARD</em> and connect it to the <em>GND</em> connection on the Arduino. Look carefully at the pictures and make sure the wires are neat as shown. Soon we will fix the wires so that it doesn't become messy. </p>

        <p>On the Arduino there is a <em>+5V</em> connection. When the Arduino is connected, this connection always produces exactly 5 volts. Because we need to connect more than 4 wires to <em>+5V</em> we will wire this connection to a free row on the breadboard. Take the red short connection wire and connect the <em>+5V</em> of the Arduino with the top left row on the breadboard as shown in the left picture below. You now have 7 instead of 4 connections with <em>+5V</em>. These connections are indicated with a red line on the picture below right.</p>

        <p>We will now repeat what we did for the <em>+5V</em> for the <em>GND</em> connection on the Arduino. Take the short black wire and connect the <em>GND connector on the Arduino with the lower left row on the breadboard. You now have 6 instead of 4 connections with <em>GND</em>. These connections are marked with a black line on the picture below right.</em>

        <p>The reflection sensors need 5 volts to work. In the previous steps you connected <em>GND</em> and <em>5V</em> to the left two rows of the breadboard. Now you are going to connect the sensor to these two rows so the sensor will be powered. Take the black <em>GND SENSOR R</em>wire from the right reflection sensor and place it in one of the holes in the bottom left corner of the breadboard that is connected to <em>GND</em> of the Arduino. Take a good look at the pictures below to see how the wire was laid along the Arduino.</p>

        <p>Both sensors are now connected. Now you connect the power supply to the Darlington drivers so that the two stepper motors can run later. If all goes well two wires of the battery should stick out of the opening of the frame, <em>VCC DARL L</em> and <em>GND DARL L</em>. Take these two wires and place them under the Arduino to the left Darlington driver.</p>

        <p>Connect the wire <em>GND DARL L</em> to the pin with the text '-' and
            <em>VCC DARL L</em> on the '+'.

        <p>Nearly all wires are now in place. The wires of the mode-switch still have to be connected so you can give the robot a command with this switch later on. Take the wire <em>GND MODE SWITCH</em> and place it in one of the last two places on the bottom left side of the breadboard. Then connect the wire <em>SIG MODE SWITCH</em> to connection 0 of the Arduino. Take a good look at the <em>Nano Pinout</em> overview where this connection is located.</p>

        <p>That's it! The wires are still a bit of a mess. We will solve this by securing the wires with the five remaining cable ties. Lay the wires neatly down and then loosely fasten the cable tie. Then place the wires a bit neater and tighten them by tightening the straps. Do not pull the ties too tightly, it is only the intention that the wires stay neatly in place. </p>

        <p>There are also a number of wires at the bottom, you also need to fasten them neatly with the same cable tie. Some cable ties require you to attach wires to the top and bottom of the cable tie. With one of the five cable ties you can't just get the cable tie through the frame. How are you going to solve this? </p>

        <p>The Darlington drivers are connected to the motors, but not yet to the Arduino. Take one of the two Darling driver cables. Connect the side with the pins (male) to the Arduino. For the right motor it must be connected to connections 6 to 9. Connect the other side of the cable to the right Darlington driver. You have to connect the cable to IN1 to IN4. Attention! Connection IN1 must be connected to connection 7 on the Arduino. If you connect it incorrectly, the robot will soon drive in exactly the opposite direction to what you want.</p>

        <h1 id="toc_10">Lesson 3, variables</h1>

        <p>Maybe you've heard of it before, variables. But what are variables actually? A variable in a program is something that can change. A variable in a program always has a type, name and a value.</p>

        <p>It's best to compare a variable with a drawer in a cabinet. You can put something in the drawer and at a later moment see what is in the drawer. You can also take something out of the drawer or replace what is in it with something else. Variables are special drawers that are only suitable for storing one thing of one kind. If you want to store multiple things you need to program multiple drawers. To be able to indicate which drawer you mean in a program, each variable has its own name.</p>

        <p>What kind of things you can store in a variable is indicated by a <em>type</em>. You also don't store your game console in a sockstand and your socks in a kitchen drawer! For now you will use three types of variables; strings, integers and booleans. What are these ?</p>

        <img style=" display: block; float:right; margin-right: auto;width:40% " src="./Student%20guide/letterstring.JPG" alt="">
        <p>A <em>String</em> is daily life is thin thread of rope. A variable of the type <em>String</em> is something like a rope of characters. So it doesn't matter if it's one or a lot of characters as long as they're consecutive. To indicate the beginning and end of a string, you have to put the characters between two double quotes, &quot;. So "This is a String" is a string, and "123 :-)". also. </p>

        <p>If you program a variable you first specify the type of the variable, then the name. By typing a &quot;=&quot; after the name of the variable you can specify what should be stored in the variable. After the <em>=</em> sign you indicate what should be stored into the variable. This is also called assigning a value. In the example below you assign the value <em>Peter</em> to the variable <em>name</em>. This variable is of the type <em>String</em>. With <em>String</em> you can tell that the type of the variable is <em>String</em>.</p>

            <div>The = sign is also called an &quot;operator&quot;. The word operator comes from mathematics and means 'operation'. So an operator makes sure that the value of a variable changes. Other operators are *, +, - etc. </div>
        </div>

        <p>Besides variables of type <em>String</em> you have integers. And integer is a whole number. The numbers 0,1,1,1,2,3,5,8,42,1138 are integers, the number 3,14159265359 are not. Because an integer always has a clear beginning and end, there are no double quotes at the beginning and end of the value. If you do, the computer thinks the value of the type <em>String</em> is.</p>

        <p>With the word <em>int</em> you indicate that the variable is of type <em>integer</em>. This variable can therefore only contain whole numbers.</p>

        <div>
            <pre><code class="language-none">int value = 42 ;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>You can also assign the same value to a variable of the String type.
        </p>

        <div>
            <pre><code class="language-none">String value = "42" ;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            There is only a big difference between the two variables above. The computer can make calculations with the <em>value</em> variable of type <em>int</em>, but because the computer does not recognize the variable <em>value</em> of type <em>String</em> as a number, it cannot make calculations with the variable of type <em>String</em>.</p>

        <p>So the computer can calculate 2 x 21 is.</p>

        <div>
            <pre><code class="language-none">int value = 21 * 2 ;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>But do not calculate what &quot;2 x 21&quot; is. The value of the variable value in the example below is '21 * 2'. It is a String, a thread of, the characters '21 * 2'.</p>
        <div>
            <pre><code class="language-none">String value = "21 * 2" ;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>The last type of variable is <em>boolean</em>. This variable has only two values, true and false. This type will be used a lot, not only in variables but also as a result of equations. If you compare something in a program, for example the value of two variables, the outcome is always true (<em>true</em>) or untrue (<em>false</em>).</p>

        <p>A variable of the boolean type is defined by the word <em>boolean</em>. In the example below, create the <em>trueornot</em> variable of the type <em>boolean</em> and assign the value <em>true</em> (true).</p>
        <div>
            <pre><code class="language-none">boolean trueornot = true ;</code></pre>

        <p>If you want to compare the contents of two variables to test if they are equal, then you indicate this with &quot;==&quot;. Each side of the &quot;==&quot; must have a variable. So the example below prints &quot;1&quot; because the contents of <em>var1</em> and <em>var2</em> are the same.</p>

        <p>In addition to the values of two variables, you can also compare the value of one variable with another value not contained in a variable.

        <h2>Smaller and larger than</h2>

        <p>In addition to comparing whether values are equal to each other, you can make more comparisons. You can compare whether one value is larger or smaller than another value. When comparing whether two values are equal, use &quot;==&quot;, to compare whether a value is greater than another value, use the &quot;&gt;&quot;.</p> character.

        <p>The equation gives <em>true</em> (is true) if the number to the left of &gt; is greater than the number to the right. You can remember this more easily by the following memory aid : Left of the &gt; sign is the distance between the lines <em>large</em>, right of the sign is the distance <em>small</em>. The sign can also be seen as an arrow pointing from <em>large</em> to <em>small</em>. If the values match the distance between the lines, the result is <em>true</em></p>.

        <p>In the following program example, the value 7 is shown on the left, the value 3 is shown straight. The arrow points from the <em>largest</em> to the <em>smallest</em> number. The result of this equation is <em>true</em> (1). The content of variable <em>var1</em> is thus <em>larger than</em> the content of variable <em>var2</em></p>.

        <pre><code class="language-none">int var1 = 7 ;
int var1 = 3 ;
    
Serial.println(var1 &gt; var2);</code></pre>

        <p>Besides a <em>larger than</em> comparison there is also a <em>less than</em> comparison. To do this, use the arrow pointing in the other direction to &quot;&lt;&quot;. If in the same program you replace the <em>larger than</em> (&gt;) equation with a <em>less than</em> (&lt;) then the result is <em>false</em> (0). Because, 7 is not less than 3</p>

        <pre><code class="language-none">int var1 = 7 ;
int var1 = 3 ;
    
Serial.println(var1 &lt; var2);</code></pre>


        <h3>Task 4.3</h3>


        <p class="assignment"> Create a new program <em>Lesson_4_largersmaller</em>. In this program, create two variables of the type <em>int</em>. Choose the names of the variables, for example <em>large</em> and <em>small</em>. Make the program compare the variables using the the <em>larger than</em> and <em>less than</em> comparators and show the result on the monitor.</p>.

        <p class="assignment">Try to run the program and see if the results of the equations are correct.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Besides comparing whole numbers with <em>&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;</em>, you can also compare String values. However, this is less obvious. Which word is larger &quot;app&quot; or &quot;apartment&quot;? It is &quot;app&quot; !</p>

        <p>It is strange, or not ? The word &quot;app&quot; is shorter than &quot;apartment&quot;, but when comparing string values, the equation starts with the first character. If this character is equal, the equation continues at the next character. The first two characters of &quot;app&quot; and &quot;apartment&quot; are equal. The third character compares &quot;p&quot; with &quot;a&quot;. The letter &quot;a&quot; occurs earlier in the alphabet and therefore is smaller, just like comparing values where 0 is smaller than 5. When comparing strings, a comparison is made per character from left to right. As soon as there is a difference between the characters, the following characters no longer apply in the equation.</p>

        <p>Below some more examples of comparisons that are true.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-none">app > apartment
primary school landje &gt; landje primary school
A &gt; 1
1 &lt; a
a4 &gt; a3</code></pre>

        <p>You can see that comparing string values is not always very easy to understand. In the further exercises we will not use this kind of comparisons.</p>


        <h2>Less than or equal and greater than or equal</h2>

        <p>You have already learned how to compare whether values are equal, smaller or larger than another value. These equations can also be combined with each other. You can not only compare whether a value is greater than another value, but also greater than or equal to another value. The comparison <code>4 &gt; 3</code> is true, but <code>4 &gt; 4</code> is not. Suppose you want to compare a value that is greater than or equal to 4. Then you can do this very easily by combining the comparison symbols, for example <code>&gt;=</code>. The result of the equation <code>4 &gt;= 4</code> is then true and <code>4 &gt;= 3</code> is also true!

            <p>In addition to the equation greater or equal , <code>&gt;=</code> there is also the equation smaller or equal, <code>&lt;=</code>. Just as with the larger or equal equation, with the smaller or equal equation, both <code>3 &lt;= 4</code> and <code>4 &lt;= 4</code> where.</p>

            <h3>Task 4.4</h3>

            <p class="assignment">Add to the program created in the previous command <em>Lesson_4_largersmaller</em> comparisons using the Less than or equal and greater than or equal equations. </p>

            <h2>Not equal to</h2>

            <p>The last equation is <em>not equal to</em>, <code>!=</code>. The result of this equation is true if both equations are not equal, so <code>3 != 7</code> is true. The exclamation mark for the = sign in the equation means <em>not</em> (NOT) , so it actually says &quot;not equal&quot;.</p>

            <h1 id="toc_12">Lesson 5, conditional statements</h1>

            <p> You will probably think, nice these comparisons, but what can you actually use those for ? Well you can use them in conditional statements ?! Conditional what ? A statement is another word for a programming instruction, a condition is something that must exist before something else can happen . It becomes a bit clearer with the following example.</p>

            <p>Say that you agree with your friend that you will give him a candy cane if he has helped you with your homework. Then the condition, is that he helped you with your homework. The instruction then is that you give him a candy cane. If you write this down so that it can be understood by a computer, it looks like this.</p>


            <pre><code class="language-none">if (help me with homework) {
  Give my friend a candy cane
}</code></pre>

            <p>You start for a computer with <em>if</em> to indicate that you set a condition that must be met. This condition is between the round brackets and the outcome may only be true or false. The outcome of a condition is therefore a <em>Boolean</em> value. After the condition you place the statements, instructions, that have to be executed if the outcome of the condition, defined between the round brackets, is true. The following example program says <em>if</em> it is true, then show &quot;The condition is true&quot;.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-none">if (true) {
  Serial.println("The condition is true") ;
}</code></pre>

            <p>The boolean value <em>true</em> is true, so if you run the program the text &quot;The condition is true&quot; is shown./p>

                <h3>Task 5.1</h3>
                <p class="assignment">Create a new program, <em>Lesson_5_condition_if</em>. In the <code>setup()</code> function, create two new variables, <code>large</code> and <code>small</code> of the <em>int</em> type. Fill this variable with a number. The number in variable <code>small</code> must be smaller than in the variable <code>large</code>. Then write an if instruction which prints the text &quot;small is smaller than large&quot; if the value in variable <code>small</code> is smaller than the value in variable <code>large</code>.</p>

                <hr/>

                <p>If all goes well the program of <em>Task 5.1</em> now prints the text "small is smaller than large". But what if the value of small <em>is not</em> smaller than large? So if the outcome condition is <em>false</em>. Then nothing will be printed now! With an if-instruction you can also execute instructions if the outcome of the condition is not true (false). This is done with the word <code>else</code>. You use the word <code>else</code> after the instructions between { and } that is executed if the outcome of the condition is true. After else, use the { and } again to indicate which instructions you want to execute if the outcome of the condition is untrue. Just look at the example below.</p>

                <pre><code class="language-none">if (true) {
  Serial.println("The condition is true") ;
} else {

                <p class="assignment">Customize the program now <em>Lesson_5_condition_if</em>. Make sure that the text "small is larger than large" is printed if the value in variable <code>small</code> is larger than the value in variable <code>large</code>. Also adjust the value of one of the variables so that the new text is printed.</p>

                <h1 id="toc_13">Lesson 6, loops</h1>

                <p>Repeatative work is boring! But sometimes useful. Just think about learning the tables. If a computer has to repeat a certain job every time you want to, you can program this more times, for example if you want to print 5x &quot;I repeat this&quot;, you can write it like this.</p>

                <pre><code class="language-none">Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
</code></pre>

                <p>For a few repetitions this is still clear, but suppose you have to repeat something a thousand times. Then the program becomes very long and still does not do much. To make this easier and more convenient there are <em>loop</em>, instructions. Of these, we'll discuss two, the <code>for</code> and the <code>while</code> loop.</p>.

                <h2>The while-loop</h2>

                <p>While means <em>as long as</em>. The instruction <code>while</code> works similarly to the instruction <code>if</code>. If you start with the name of the instruction, <code>while</code>, a condition will appear between two round brackets and instructions between { and }. These last two characters are also called braces. </p>

                <pre><code class="language-none">while (true) {
  Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
}
</code></pre>

                <p>The <code>while</code> instruction repeats the instructions between the braces as long as the outcome of the condition is true.</p>

                <div style="overflow: auto;margin: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">
                    <img style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;" src="./Student%20guide/doe_icoon.png" width="50" alt="Doe" />
                    <div>Do you know how long the above <code>while</code> loop repeats printing the text?</div>
                </div>

                <p>If you want a <code>while</code> loop to stop repeating at some point, you must make sure that the condition changes from <em>true</em> to <em>false</em> during the repeat. If you don't make sure the outcome of the condition changes, the repeat will never stop.</p>

                <p>Check the example below and try to understand when the <code>while</code> condition changes.</p>


                <pre><code class="language-none">int number = 1 ;
  
while (number &lt; 10) {
  Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
  number = number + 1;
}
  </code></pre>

                <p>The program starts by creating a variable <code>number</code> and assigns it the value &quot;1&quot;. The condition <code>number &lt;= 10</code> in the while-loop then is true. The text &quot;I repeat this&quot; will then be printed. Then the instruction <code>number = number + 1</code> is executed. The variable <em>number</em> will get a new value here. This new value is the current value in variable number, &quot;1&quot;, plus 1. The new content of variable <em>number</em> becomes 2. The result of the while-loop condition is still true, so the instructions between { and } will be repeated again.
                </p>

                <h3>Task 6.1</h3>
                <p class="assignment">Try now to find out how often the text &quot;I repeat this&quot; is printed by the previous example program.

                <h2>The for-loop</h2>

                <p>The for-loop also allows you to repeat multiple instructions. Instead of just a condition, you have to place a <em>initialization</em>, <em>condition</em> and <em>increment</em> between the round brackets in a <code>for-loop</code>. But what are <em>initialization</em>, <em>condition</em> and <em>increment</em>?</p>

                <p>Initialization means creating again, it is creating a variable and assigning an initial value. The instruction <code>int number=1</code> for the while-loop example program showb below is the initialization of the variable <em>number</em></p>.

                <p>You have already dealed with a condition before, this is for example <code>number &lt; 10</code> shown in the while-loop example program below.</p>

                <p>Increment is another word for addition. With this you indicate how much the value of a variable will be increased. In the while-loop example program this is executed in the loop by the instruction <code>number = number + 1</code>.</p>.

                <p>The <em>initialization</em>, <em>condition</em> and <em>increment</em> in a for-loop must appear in parentheses after the instruction <code>for</code>. Between the <em>initialization</em>, <em>condition</em> and <em>increment</em> type a semicolon (;). So it looks like this</p>

                <pre class="assignment"><code class="language-none">for (initialization;condition;increment) {

                <p>If we want to do exactly the same with a for-loop as in the &quot;I repeat this&quot; while-loop program, the program looks like this.</p>

                <pre class="assignment"><code class="language-none">for (int number=1;number&lt;10;number=number+1) {
  Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
}
</code></pre>

                <p>In a for-loop you actually put all instructions which ensure a good progression of the repetition together. The variable is initialized, <em>number</em> gets the value 1. Each repetition a value of 1 is added to the value of the variable <em>number</em>. And the instructions are repeated as long as the value of the variable <em>number</em> is less than 10.</p>

                <p> If you want to increase the content of a variable by exactly 1, you can also write it down differently. By typing &quot;++&quot; after the name of a variable, for example <code>number+++</code>, this is the same as <code>number = number + 1</code>, so the previous program does exactly the same as the program below.</p>


                <pre class="assignment"><code class="language-none">for (int number=1;number&lt;10;number++) {
  Serial.println("I repeat this") ;
}
</code></pre>


                <h3>Task 6.2</h3>
                <p class="assignment">This will be a more difficult task, so take your time and think carefully. Write a program that calculates the power of a number. If you want to calculate 2 to the power 4, you calculate the outcome of 2x2x2x2. Two times two is four, four times two is eight and eight times two is sixteen. Two to the power 4 therefore is 16. To calculate a power of a number you need a <em>ground number</em> and a <em>exponent</em>. The base number is the number you want to multiply, the exponent is the number of times you want to multiply the number.</p>

                <p class="assignment">Start the program by creating three variables, <code>ground</code>, <code>exponent</code> and <code>result</code>. Decide for yourself which type of variable you use. Make the content of the variable <code>result</code> equal to the value of <code>ground</code> and choose your own value for the variables <code>ground</code> and <code>exponent</code>. Start with small numbers to keep it comprehensible.</p>

                <p class="assignment"> Then write in a for-loop the calculation of the power of the number in variable <code>ground</code>. Use the variable <code>exponent</code> in the condition. In the for-loop you use a separate variable <code>x</code> for initialization, condition and increment.</p>.

                <p class="assignment">Print the value of variable <code>result</code> after the for-loop is finished. Test your program with base 3 and exponent 5. If the result of the program is 243, then the program works well.</p>

                <h1 id="toc_14">Lesson 7, debugging</h1>


                <p class="assignment">Finding and solving errors in a program is called &quot;debugging&quot;. There are two types of errors in computer programs, syntactic and runtime errors. </p>

                <h2>Syntactic errors</h2>

                <p>What are these for errors ? A syntactic error is something like a speling mistake 😉. So you can already detect syntactic errors before you run a program. If you follow the rules of the programming language exactly, you will never make syntactic errors. But there are a lot of rules. So this is actually a job for a program to track these errors down. This program is also included in your IDE which you can start by clicking the verify button. </p>

                <h3>Task 7.1</h3>

                <p class="assignment">Create a new program in Arduino Create and call it <em>Lesson_7_debugging</em>. Then cut and paste the program below over the current standard program rules. Then find in your Arduino Create ID the verify button. Found it? Click there and see what happens.

                    <p>Check the error message in the red bar underneath the program. Do you see what is wrong?</p>
                    <hr/>

                    <p>Als je het programma van <em>Opdracht 7.1</em> controleert op syntactische fouten geeft de IDE aan <code>expected</code> &apos;;&apos; before &apos;}&apos; token. <em>Expected</em> betekent verwachtte en <em>token</em> betekent teken. De IDE verwachtte dus het teken &quot;;&quot; voor het &quot;}&quot; teken.
                    </p>

                    <p>Maar waar dan? Want er staan wel meer &quot;}&quot; tekens in het programma. Onder de foutmelding wordt in het zwarte kader de foutmelding uitgebreider beschreven. Nog steeds is het niet gemakkelijk, maar als je vaak rustig leest staat er precies waar de fout zicht bevindt.</p>

                    <p>De eerste rode afgedrukte regel geeft bijvoorbeeld aan in welke functie de fout zit, <code>In function &apos;void setup()&apos;:</code>. De fout zit dus niet in de functie <code>loop()</code>, maar in <code>setup()</code>.</p>

                    <p>In de volgend rode afgedrukte regel staat iets wat waarschijnlijk lijkt op <code>debuggen.ino:12:1 error: expected &apos;;&apos; before &apos;}&apos; token</code>. De tekst <code>12:1</code> geeft precies aan waar in het programma de fout zit, regel 12 en het eerste teken. De IDE verachte op die plek dus een &quot;;&quot; voor het &quot;}&quot; teken.</p>


                    <h3>Opdracht 7.2</h3>

                    <p class="assignment">Haal nu met de aanwijzingen in de foutmeldingen de fout uit het programma. Waar zou jij de &quot;;&quot; zetten als je het netjes zou doen ?</p>
                    <hr/>


                    <h2>Runtime fouten</h2>

                    <p>Runtime fouten zijn fouten die ontstaan tijdens het uitvoeren van een programma. Uitvoeren noemen we in het Engels &quot;runnen&quot;. Als er een runtime fout in een programma zit hoeft deze niet op te treden, maar het kan soms wel optreden. Hieronder zie je een programma waar een runtime fout in zit. Begin het programma te lezen vanaf de regel <code>int getal = 5;</code>. De programma regels voor deze regel zorgen er onder andere voor dat het programma een willekeurig getal kiest. De functie <code>random(1,10)</code> kiest een willekeurig getal van 1 tot en met 10.</p>

                    <pre><code class="language-none">void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  delay(2000);
  pinMode(A1,INPUT) ;
  randomSeed(analogRead(A1)); 
  
  int getal = 5;
  Serial.println("start getal");
  Serial.println(getal);
  
  int teller = random(1, 10);
  Serial.println("start teller");
  Serial.println(teller);
  
  while (getal != teller) {
    Serial.println("teller");
    Serial.println(teller);
    teller++ ;
  }
  
  Serial.println("Klaar!");
    
}

void loop() {
    
}
    </code>
    </pre>

                    <p>Eerst wordt in de variabele <code>getal</code> de waarde <em>5</em> gezet. Vervolgens wordt dit getoond in het console van je IDE. Daarna wordt in variabele <code>teller</code> een willekeurig getal van 1 tot en met 10 geplaats. Elke keer dat je het programma start zal hier dus een andere waarde in gezet worden.</p>

                    <p>Daarna gaat het programma een aantal programma regels herhalen. Dit blijft de computer herhalen zolang de waarde van <code>getal</code> ongelijk is aan <code>teller</code>. Daar lijkt niets mis mee toch ?</p>

                    <h3>Opdracht 7.3</h3>

                    <p class="assignment">Maak een nieuw programma en knip en plak de bovenstaande programmaregels in het programma. Houd vervolgens een vinger op de pin <em>A1</em> van de Arduino. Het maakt niet uit of je ook nog een andere pin aanraakt. Doordat je contact maakt met pin <em>A1</em> zal er van de computer naar jou een heel klein stroompje electriciteit lopen. Hoeveel electriciteit er door jou heen loopt verschilt per keer, dit gebruikt de Arduino weer om een willekeurig getal te maken. </p>

                    <p class="assignment">Start vervolgens het programma een paar keer.</p>

                    <p class="assignment">Je ziet waarschijnlijk dat het programma netjes na een paar keer printen van een getal &quot;Klaar!&quot; print zoals in het voorbeeld hieronder.</p>

                    <pre><code class="language-none">start getal

                    <p class="assignment">Dit gaat niet altijd zo, als er een fout runtime fout optreed in het programma blijft de teller maar doorlopen.</p>

                    <p class="assignment">Hoe komt dat? Runtime fouten zijn helaas niet heel eenvoudig te vinden. Belangrijk is dat je precies te werk gaat en stap voor stap het programma probeert te debuggen. Doe dit door stap-voor-stap door de programma regels te gaan en op te schrijven wat de inhoud van de variabelen zijn en wat de uitkomsten van condities zijn.</p>

                    <p class="assignment">Hieronder zie je een voorbeeld hoe je dit op kan schrijven. Naast de inhoud van de variabelen staat ook nog het regelnummer in het programma waar de variabele van waarde wijzigt of de conditie getest wordt. Probeer nu aan de hand van onderstaande stappen te begrijpen hoe het programma verloopt. Op regel 12 krijgt de variabele <code>teller</code>het willekeurige getal 3. </p>

                    <pre><code class="language-none">Stap     Regel    Getal    Teller   Getal!=Teller
  1          8        5         -          -
  2         12        5         3          -
  3         16        5         3        True
  4         19        5         4          -
  5         16        5         4        True
  6         19        5         5          -
  7         16        5         5        False  
</code></pre>

                    <p class="assignment">Nu moet je zelf de stappen gaan opschrijven zoals in het voorbeeld hierboven. Alleen krijgt de variabele <code>teller</code>op regel 12 hier de willekeurige waarde 6.</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-none">Stap     Regel    Getal    Teller   Getal!=Teller

                    <p class="assignment">Zoals je ziet gaat er hier iets mis. Wat moet je aan het programma aanpassen om deze bug te verhelpen?</p>
                    <hr/>

                    <h1 id="toc_15">Les 8, de robot instructie set</h1>
                    <p>Je kunt nu al programmeren en debuggen! In de volgende lessen zul je meer instructies leren. Naat de standaard C instructies heeft deze robot speciale instructies voor de robot. Deze instructies kun je vinden in de <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20NLD.html" target="_blank">Landje robot instructieset</a></p>

                    <p>Met deze speciale instructieset kun je de robot laten rijden, kijken, afstand meten en lijnen op de vloer herkennen. Door deze functies te combineren in een programma kun je bijvoorbeeld de robot een lijn op de vloer laten volgen. Maar je kunt hem ook laten rondrijden zonder tegen iets op te botsen.</p>

                    <h2>De eerste robot instructie, move</h2>

                    <p>Move betekent &quot;bewegen&quot;. In de volgende opdracht zul je robot door middel van de instructie <code>move</code> echt laten bewegen. Het is een opdracht waarin je best wel even moet lezen en dingen uitzoeken, dus neem je tijd.</p>


                    <h3>Opdracht 8.1</h3>

                    <p class="assignment">Lees nu de <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20NLD.html" target="_blank">Landjerobot instructieset</a> tot aan de <em>Instructies</em>.</p>

                    <p class="assignment">Om de Landjerobot instructies te kunnen gebruiken in je programma moeten deze instructies toegevoegd worden aan de bibliotheek van je IDE. Een bibliotheek, of library, is een verzameling van programma's die bij elkaar horen. Voor de Landjerobot is de library, je raad het al, <em>LandjeRobot</em>. Voordat je de library kan toevoegen, moet je hem eerst downloaden. Je kunt deze library <a href="https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/raw/master/LandjeRobot.zip">hier</a> downloaden</p>

                    <p class="assignment">Maak nu een nieuw programma <em>robot_beweegt</em>. Maak nu gebruik van de <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20NLD.html" target="_blank">Landjerobot instructieset</a> om in de functie <code>setup()</code> een instructie te schrijven waardoor de robot 10cm vooruit rijdt. Vergeet ook niet de instructies zoals deze bovenaan in de <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20NLD.html" target="_blank">Landjerobot instructieset</a> staan naar jouw programma te knippen en te plakken. Zorg ervoor dat je voordat je het programma naar de robot stuurt de ON/OFF schakelaar op <em>OFF</em> staat.</p>

                    <p class="assignment">Denk je dat het programma goed is? Haal dan de USB kabel uit de robot, zet 4 batterijen in de batterijhouder en zet de robot aan.</p>

                    <hr/>


                    <h2>Move herhalen</h2>

                    <p>Zoals je gezien hebt kun je met de <code>move</code> instructie de robot vooruit laten rijden. Met een andere instructie <code>turn</code> kun je de robot in een richting draaien. Hoever je de robot draait geeft je aan in graden. Kijk eens in de <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20NLD.html" target="_blank">Landje robot instructieset</a> bij de instructie <code>turn</code>. Bij het plaatje van de robot zie je een cirkel die is verdeeld in 360 stukjes, deze stukjes noem je graden. Als je de robot 360 graden laat draaien, maakt hij een heel rondje. Bij 90 graden maakt de robot een rechte hoek.</p>

                    <p>Door gebruik te maken van de <code>move</code> en <code>turn</code> instructie kun je de robot een vierkantje laten rijden. Als je de robot eerst vooruit laat bewegen, en dan draait heeft hij de eerste zijde van een vierkant afgelegd en staat hij klaar voor de tweede zijde. Als je dit vier keer herhaalt rijdt hij precies een vierkant.</p>

                    <p>Dit is misschien in het begin moeilijk te begrijpen. Wat kan helpen is door zelf de instructies na te spelen. Print daarvoor het onderstaande afbeelding af van de robot, of teken hem na op een stuk papier. Knip deze vervolgens uit.</p>

                    <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;width:40% " src="./Student%20guide/Lesson_8_Robot.png" alt="">

                    <p>Gebruik nu onderstaande &quot;instructies&quot; en gebruik jouw papierenrobot om de instructies uit te voeren. Leg de robot neer op een tafel en beweeg hem volgens de instructies. Als je deze opvolgt zal de robot zich in een vierkant verplaatsen en weer uitkomen op de positie waar het begonnen was. </p>

                    <pre><code class="language-none">Beweeg 10cm vooruit

Draai 90 graden naar links</code></pre>

                    <h3>Opdracht 8.2</h3>

                    <p class="assignment">Nu je weet hoe je de robot in een vierkant kunt laten rijden mag je dit zelf gaan programmeren. De <code>move</code> en <code>turn</code> instructies hebben verschillende syntaxis (meervoud van syntax). Zo heb je voor de instructie <code>move</code> de syntax <code>move( richting , afstand) ;</code> en <code>move( richting , afstand, wachten) ;</code></p>

                    <p class="assignment">Het verschil tussen beide syntaxis is dat bij de eerste syntax alleen de richting en afstand kan worden opgegeven. Bij de tweede kan ook aangegeven worden dat de instructie wacht totdat de actie, het bewegen van de robot over een afstand, is afgerond. Als je bij de <code>move</code> en <code>turn</code> instructie niet aangeeft dat het moet wachten tot het afgerond is zal de robot alle <code>move</code> en <code>turn</code> instructies hebben afgerond voordat de robot een centimeter heeft gereden! </p>

                    <p class="assignment">Maak nu een nieuw programma &quot;beweeg_vierkant&quot; en programmeer in de functie <code>setup()</code> de instructies om de robot zich in een vierkant te laten bewegen.</p>

                    <p class="assignment">Als je denkt dat het programma goed werkt, upload het dan naar de robot en zet hem aan. Vergeet niet de USB kabel eruit te halen!</p>

                    <hr/>

                    <h2>DRY</h2>

                    <p>Dry betekent in het Engels &quot;droog&quot;. Het is ook in het Engels een afkorting welke elke programmeur kent. Het is een afkorting van Don't Repeat Yourself, wat &quot;herhaal jezelf niet&quot; betekent. Waarschijnlijk heb jij in Opdracht 8.2 vier keer de <code>move</code> en <code>turn</code> instructie geschreven. Dit is goed, maar wat als je de robot in plaats van een vierkant van 10cm een vierkant van 15 centimeter wilt laten rijden ? Dan moet je het programma op 4 plekken aanpassen! Het is dus beter om herhalingen van instructies in programma's te voorkomen. Dus als je programmeert, DRY!</p>



                    <h3>Opdracht 8.3</h3>

                    <p class="assignment">Pas het programma van Opdracht 8.2 aan zodat je nog maar &egrave;&egrave;n keer de <code>move</code> en <code>turn</code> instructies gebruikt om de robot in een vierkant te laten bewegen. Heb je even geen idee hoe je dit zou moeten doen, kijk dan eens in hoofdstuk 6, succes!</p>


                    <h2>Sensors gebruiken</h2>


                    <p>Landjerobot heeft meerdere sensors. Sensors waarmee je afstand kunt meten, een schakelaar en reflectiesensors. Deze sensors kun je gebruiken om een lijn op een vloer te detecteren. Deze sensors werken het beste op een donkere vloer welke een gelijkmatige kleur heeft. Op deze vloer ga je straks een stukje wit tape plakken zodat de sensor deze kan detecteren.</p>

                    <h3>Opdracht 8.4</h3>

                    <p class="assignment">In deze opdracht ga je de refelectiesensors afstellen. De sensors geven een voor mensen onzichtbaar licht en meten dan of dat licht gereflecteerd wordt. Je kunt deze sensors afstellen zodat ze bij een bepaalde hoeveelheid gereflecteerd licht een signaal geven. Je kunt de sensor dus het beste gebruiken op een donkere vloer met witte tape of een lichte tape met een donkere vloer zodat de sensor het beste het verschil tussen vloer en tape kan detecteren. Je moet de reflectiesensors anders afstellen als je op een donkere vloer gaat rijden dan op een lichte vloer. In deze opdracht kun je voor jouw vloer de juiste stappen vinden om de reflectiesensors goed af te stellen.</p>

                    <p class="assignment">Omdat je straks de robot aan moet zetten om de sensors af te stellen is het handig dat hij niet ineens begint te rijden. Maak daarom in je IDE een leeg programma en upload dit naar de robot.</p>


                    <b class="assignment">lichte vloer</b>
                    <p class="assignment">Haal de USB kabel uit de robot en zet hem aan. Op de reflectiesensors zit een klein blauw blokje met hier in het midden een klein schroefgaatje. Neem de kleinste Phillips schroevedraaier (die in de vorm van een kruisje) en draai heel voorzichtig het schroefjes van beide sensors naar links. Plak nu een stukje wit tape op de vloer en zet een van de sensors boven het witte tape. Als het goed is brandt er maar &eacute;&eacute;n ledje op de sensor. Draai vervolgens het schroefje langzaam naar rechts totdat een tweede ledje gaat branden. Herhaal dit voor de andere sensor.</p>

                    <p class="assignment">Als je een nieuw programma voor de robot start moet je altijd een aantal regels vanuit de <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20NLD.html" target="_blank">Landjerobot instructieset</a> kopieren. Een van deze regels ziet er zo uit. </p>

                    <pre><code>const bool lineSensorInverse = false ;</code></pre>

                    <p class="assignment">Als je een donkere vloer hebt, moet je bij elk programma dat je maakt deze regel veranderen in.</p>

                    <p class="assignment">Door de waarde van <code>false</code> naar <code>true</code> te veranderen, weet de robot dat je een donkere lijn op een lichte vloer gebruik, in plaats van een lichte lijn op een donkere vloer.</p>

                    <p>Met de instructie <code>detectLine()</code> kun je testen of de robot een lijn ziet en met welke, de linker of rechter, sensor. Als je in de <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20NLD.html" target="_blank">Landje robot instructieset</a> leest, zie je dat deze instructie vier verschillende waarden terug kan geven. Afhankelijk van </p>


                    <h3>Opdracht 8.5</h3>

                    <p class="assignment">Schrijf nu een programma dat de robot recht vooruit laat rijden en laat stoppen als een van de sensors detecteert dat er over het witte tape wordt gereden. Begin met de instructie <code>move(richting);</code> zodat de robot gelijk gaat rijden en niet wacht totdat de instructie is afgerond. Deze instructie zet je in de <code>setup()</code> functie. De <code>setup()</code> wordt maar &eacute;&eacute;n keer aangeroepen, als je de robot aanzet. Hierdoor start de robot met rijden als je hem aanzet, en zal hij niet meer gaan rijden nadat hij gestopt is. Schrijf daarna in de functie <code>loop()</code> je programma dat ervoor zorgt dat <em>als</em> de sensor <em>niet niets</em> detecteert de robot laat stoppen met rijden.</p>

                    <p class="assignment">De <code>detectLine</code> instructie kan vier verschillende waarden teruggeven <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::NONE</code>, <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::LEFT</code>, <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::RIGHT</code> en <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::BOTH</code>. De robot moet dus stoppen als of deze de waarde <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::LEFT</code>, <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::RIGHT</code> of <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::BOTH</code> teruggeeft. Kun je dit misschien ook schrijven door alleen gebruik te maken van <code>LandjeRobot::LINE::NONE</code> ? Dat zou het schrijven van de code voor het stoppen van de robot namelijk wel veel eenvoudiger maken!</p>

                    <h1 id="toc_16">Les 9, Lijnen volgen</h1>

                    <p>In deze les ga je leren om sensors te programmeren. Met sensors kun je dingen waarnemen, zoals met bijvoorbeeld de reflectiesensors, het verschil tussen lichte en donkere oppervlakken op een vloer. Met de gegevens van deze sensor ga je vervolgens de robot hierop laten reageren.</p>

                            <p>Je hebt nu al geleerd hoe je de robot in elkaar zet, eenvoudige programma's geschreven en de robot laten rijden en stoppen met robot instructies. In deze les ga je leren hoe je de robot zelfstandig langs een lijn laat rijden. </p>

                            <p>Met behulp van de reflectiesensors ga je detecteren wanneer een sensor over een lijn gaat. Als deze over een lijn gaat zult je iets moeten doen om ervoor te zorgen dat de robot weer netjes de lijn gaat volgen. </p>

                            <p>In het voorbeeld hiernaast zal de robot als deze recht vooruit blijft rijden geen enkele keer met de reflectiesensors over de lijn gaan. Je hoeft de robot dus niet bij te sturen om het de lijn te laten volgen. </p>

                                <p>Maar wat gebeurt er nu als de robot niet precies met beide sensors de &quot;keerlijn&quot; ziet? Kijk eens naar de afbeelding hiernaast. De rechter sensor ziet de &quot;keerlijn&quot; net iets eerder dan de linker sensor.</p>

                                <p class="assignment">Probeer nu met je papieren robot te verzinnen en je programma van opdracht 9.1 hoe je kunt voorkomen dat de robot blijft wiebelen voor de &quot;keerlijn&quot;. Hoe kun je voorkomen dat de robot gelijk naar links of rechts gaat als hij niet helemaal perfect recht op de &quot;keerlijn&quot; uitkomt? </p>

                                <p class="assignment">Tip: Kijk eens in de <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20NLD.html" target="_blank">Landje robot instructieset</a> naar de instructie <code>delay</code>, kun je hier misschien iets mee?.</p>

                        <h3>Opdracht 9.3</h3>

                        <p class="assignment">Plak met tape de keerlijnen aan het begin en einde van de lijn die de robot moet volgen. Maak de lijnen breed genoeg, ongeveer net zo breed als de wielen van de robot uit elkaar staan. Maak de keerlijnen twee keer zo dik door twee stroken tape naast elkaar te plakken.
                        </p>

                        <p class="assignment">Omdat jij waarschijnlijk in opdracht 9.1 je eigen oplossing hebt gemaakt ga je verder met de oplossing zoals deze hieronder staat. Kopieer onderstaande oplossing voor opdracht 9.1 in jouw programma, &quot;Mijn_Robot&quot;. Er staat ook commentaar bij dat uitlegt wat de instructies doen. Probeer dit programma dus eerst goed te begrijpen voordat je verder gaat.</p>

                        <pre><code>void setup() {

       // Start met rijden als de robot aangezet wordt en
       // wacht niet
       landjerobot.move(LandjeRobot::DIRECTION::FORWARD) ;
  
}

void loop() {

    // Als er niet niets (!) gedetecteerd wordt door de 
    // reflectie sensors doe dan iets
    if (landjerobot.detectLine() != LandjeRobot::LINE::NONE) {
            
        // Als de reflectie sensors links een lijn detecteren
        if (landjerobot.detectLine() == LandjeRobot::LINE::LEFT) {
            // Draai 10 graden naar links en wacht
            landjerobot.turn(LandjeRobot::TURN::LEFT,10,true) ;
        }
    
        // Als de reflectie sensors rechts een lijn detecteren
        if (landjerobot.detectLine() == LandjeRobot::LINE::RIGHT) {
            // Draai 10 graden naar rechts en wacht
            landjerobot.turn(LandjeRobot::TURN::RIGHT,10,true) ;
        }
    
        // Laat de robot weer verder rijden
        landjerobot.move(LandjeRobot::DIRECTION::FORWARD) ;
    
    } // einde if
  
}</code></pre>

                        <p class="assignment">Ga nu je programma uitbreiden. Zorg ervoor dat de robot bij een &quot;keerlijn&quot; omdraait. Als hij omgedraaid is moet de robot weer in de andere richting de lijn gaat volgen, om vervolgens bij de volgende &quot;keerlijn&quot; weer om te keren.</p>

                        <p class="assignment">De robot moet dus keren als zowel de linker als rechte reflectiesensor de lijn ziet. Om dit te programmeren kun je de bestaande programmaregels welke de robot naar links en rechts laten draaien als voorbeeld gebruiken.</p>

                        <p class="assignment">Dan moet je er nog voor zorgen dat de robot niet blijft wiebelen voor de &quot;keerlijn&quot;. Programmeer wat je in opdracht 8.7 hebt verzonnen om de robot goed te laten keren en probeer of het werkt. Lukt het niet? Probeer dan te debuggen wat er fout gaat. Het helpt als je weer met je papieren robot het programma stap voor stap doorloopt.</p>

                        <hr/>

                        <h2>De mode schakelaar</h2>

                        <p>Je hebt nu een programma klaar dat er voor zorgt dat de robot langs een lijn rijdt en weer keert bij een keerlijn. Straks ga je de robot met een ander programma zelf laten rondrijden en om andere robots en voorwerpen heen rijden. Het zou handig zijn als je beide programma's op de robot kan opslaan en bij het aanzetten van de robot kan kiezen welk programma de robot dan gaat uitvoeren.</p>

                        <p>Hiervoor moet je wel iets hebben om dit aan de robot te kunnen doorgeven. Dat kan zonder dat je de robot weer op een computer moet aansluiten met de mode schakelaar. Deze schakelaar heeft twee standen, 1 en 2. Door middel van de instructie <code>mode</code> kun je bepalen in welke stand de schakelaar staat.</p>

                        <h3>Opdracht 9.4</h3>
                        <p class="assignment">In deze opdracht ga je ervoor zorgen dat de robot jouw tot nu to geschreven programma, "Mijn_Robot", alleen start als de mode schakelaar op stand &quot;1&quot; staat. Als de schakelaar in stand &quot;2&quot; mag de robot niets doen. Later ga je ervoor zorgen dat in stand 2 een ander programma gestart wordt.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Lees hoe de instructie <code>mode</code> werkt in de <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20NLD.html" target="_blank">Landje robot instructieset</a></li>
                            <li>Plaats voor de functie <code>setup()</code> een variabele <code>mode</code> van het type <code>int</code> en geeft het de waarde <code>0</code>. Als je een variabele in een functie aanmaakt kun je hem alleen in deze functie gebruiken. Als je bijvoorbeeld de variabele <code>mode</code> in de functie <code>setup()</code> maakt, kun je hem niet gebruiken in de functie <code>loop()</code>. De functie <code>loop()</code> kent dan deze variabele niet. Als je een variabele maakt voor de functie <code>setup()</code> en <code>loop()</code> kun je ze in beide functie gebruiken.
                            </li>
                            <li>Schrijf in de functie <code>setup()</code> een stukje programma dat ervoor zorgt dat de variabele <code>mode</code> de waarde uit de landje robot instructie <code>mode</code> krijgt.</li>
                            <li>Laat in de functie <code>setup()</code> de robot alleen starten met rijden als de variabele <code>mode</code> de waarde &quot;1&quot; heeft.</li>
                            <li>Pas de functie <code>loop</code> in je programma zo aan, dat de instructies zoals je deze in opdracht 9.3 hebt afgerond alleen uitvoert als de schakelaar bij het starten van de robot op stand 1 staat.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Als alles goed verlopen is heb je het eerste programma van de robot nu helemaal klaar! Test het programma nu.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Zet de robot uit en zet de mode-schakelaar op "1".</li>
                            <li>Plaats de robot op de lijn en zet hem aan. De robot zou nu de lijn moeten volgen en bij de dubbele lijn weer omkeren.</li>
                            <li>Zet de robot uit en zet de mode-schakelaar op "2"</li>
                            <li>Plaats de robot op de lijn en zet hem aan. Als het helemaal goed is blijft de robot stilstaan</li>

                        <h1 id="toc_17">Les 10, Meer sensors en motoren</h1>

                        <h2>Plaatsen van het robot hoofd</h2>

                        <p>In het hoofd van de robot van de robot zitten een ultrasoon sensor en een led'je. De ultrasoon sensor kan afstand meten met een voor ons niet hoorbaar geluid. Het meet een afstand door een geluidje te maken en te wachten totdat de echo van dit geluid weer terugkomt. Door middel van de tijd welke ligt tussen het vezenden en het weer ontvangen van het geluid kan de computer de afstand berekenen. Het led'je in de mond van de robot kun je laten knipperen zodat het lijkt of het praat. Je kunt het led'je ook aan- of uitzetten en opvragen of het knippert.</p>

                        <p>Het hoofd van de robot komt op een motorje. Dit is geen gewoon motortje, maar een servo-motor. Een servo-motor kan niet rondjes draaien. Deze motor kan de as precies een half rondje, 180 graden, naar links <em>en</em> naar rechts draaien. Omdat de motor precies weet in welke stand de as staat, kun je aangeven hoevell graden het naar links of rechts moet bewegen.</p>

                        <p>Straks kun je met de instructie <code>look</code> de richting van de as sturen. De as kun je dan 45 en 90 graden naar links en rechts draaien en precies in het midden zetten. Door het draaien van deze as kun je straks, na het vastzetten van het hoofd van de robot, deze naar links en rechts laten kijken.</p>

                        <p>Nu is het wel zo handig dat je weet in welke stand de motor staat <em>voordat</em> je het hoofd er op schroeft. Anders is de kans groot dat de robot altijd een andere kan op kijkt dan dat jij wilt dat het kijkt. Daarom ga je eerst ervoor zorgen dat de as van de servo-motor precies in het midden staat voordat je het hoofd van de robot vastmaakt.</p>

                        <h3>Opdracht 10.1</h3>

                                        <li>Test het programma, kijkt de robot naar links, dan naar voren en uiteindelijk helemaal naar rechts ? Mooi ! Schroef dan het hoofd vast met het schroefje van de servo-motor. Gebruik het kleinste schroefje dat in het zakje zit bij de servo-motor. Kijkt de robot niet helemaal naar links? Haal het hoofd dan van de servo-motor en begin de opdracht dan opnieuw. </li>

Sluit de draad VCC MOUTH aan op pin 15 van de Arduino, daarna sluit je de laatste draad SIG ULTRA aan op pin 13.</p>

                        <p>De robot heeft nu mond waarmee het kan 'praten' en een paar ogen waarmee het echt kan kijken. In de volgende opdrachten ga je leren hoe je de robot kunt laten kijken en praten.</p>

                        <h3>Opdracht 10.2</h3>
                        <p class="assignment">Nu je het hoofd van de robot heb aangesloten is de robot compleet. Op het hoofd van de robot zitten de ultrasoon sensor waarmee je afstanden kunt meten. Ook zit er een led in de mond dat je kunt laten branden. Je kunt de led aan of uit zetten. Ook kun je het laten knipperen voor een aantal seconden. Zoek in de <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20NLD.html" target="_blank">Landje robot instructieset</a> de instructies die je hiervoor nodig hebt. Maak een nieuw programma en probeer deze drie instructies uit. Schrijf bijvoorbeeld instructies die de led laat branden, uit zet en laat knipperen. Tussen deze instructies kun je de <code>delay()</code> instructie gebruiken om even te wachten.</p>

                                <p>In het hoofd van de robot zit een ultrasoon sensor om afstanden mee te meten, maar hoe werkt deze eigenlijk ? Als de sensor de afstand gaat meten maakt het geluid. Dit geluid is een hoge pieptoon die wij mensen niet kunnen horen. Dit geluid gaat in de richting waar de sensor heen gericht is. Als het geluid iets op zijn weg komt, wordt het geluid weerkaatst en komt het weer terug naar de sensor. Het weerkaatsen van geluid noemen we 'echo'. Zodra de sensor het verstuurde geluid weer ontvangen is, meet het hoe lang het geluid onderweg is geweest van de sensor naar het voorwerp en weer terug.

                                    <p>Geluid verplaatst zich met een snelheid van ongeveer 343 meter per seconde of ruim 1200 km/h! Omdat we weten hoe snel geluid zich verplaatst kunnen we met behulp van de gemeten tijd uitrekenen wat de afstand is tussen de sensor en het voorwerp.</p>

                                    <h3>Opdracht 10.3</h3>
                                    <p class="assignment">Als je in de bergen een gil geeft naar een berg hoor je na 12 seconden de echo. Reken uit hoe ver de berg van je af staat.</p>

                                    <h3>Opdracht 10.4</h3>
                                    <p class="assignment">In deze opdracht ga je de robot afstand laten meten met behulp van de ultrasoon sensor. Maak een in de Arduino Web editor een nieuw programma, <em>meten_afstand</em></p>

                                    <p>Om het alvast iets makkelijker te maken krijg je onderstaande programma. Knip en plak dit programma in het nieuwe programma <em>meten_afstand</em>. Vervang daarna op de 3 plekken met <em>...</em> op met de juiste instructies </p>
                                    <pre><code>void setup() {

    delay(2000);
    
    // druk de gemeten afstand af zolang
    // de afstand groter is dan 5 cm.

      Serial.println(afstand) ;
    }
    
    // Laat de robot 10 seconden praten

                                    <p>Test het programma door het programma te starten en de monitor in de Ardunio Web editor te openen. Beweeg nu je hand heel langzaam naar de sensor toe. Als het allemaal goed is zal de robot gaan 'praten' als je minder dan 5 cm vanaf de sensor is.</p>

                        <h1 id="toc_18">Les 11, Een nieuw programma</h1>

                        <div style="">
                            <div style="float:right;width:49%;margin-right: 7px ">

                                <p>In de vorige lessen heb je het eerste programma voor de robot geschreven. Dit programma zorgde ervoor dat de robot een lijn kan volgen en aan het einde van een lijn omkeert. Je startte dit programma door ervoor te zorgen dat de <em>mode</em> schakelaar op "<em>1</em>" stond bij het aanzetten van de robot.</p>


                                <p>In de volgende lessen ga je het programma uitbreiden. Deze uitbreiding van het programma zal gestart worden als de <em>mode</em> schakelaar bij het aanzetten van de robot op "<em>2</em>" staat.</p>

                                <p>In plaats van het volgen van een lijn, zul je nu de robot binnen een gebied laten bewegen. Dit gebied maak je door met tape op de vloer de buitenkant te markeren, net zoals op het voorbeeld hier links. Als de robot tijdens het rijden een lijn detecteerd moet de robot draaien en verder rijden binnen het gebied.
                                </p>

                                <p>Daarnaast ga je gebruik maken van de ogen van de robot, het kan nu immers zien of er iets staat waar omheen gereden moet worden.</p>

                                <h3>Opdracht 11.1</h3>
                                <p class="assignment">Het is weer tijd om je papieren robot te gebruiken! Pak een vel papier en teken net zoals in de afbeelding hiernaast een rechthoek met een dikke stift. Plaats je papieren robot in het rechthoek en ga er mee rijden.</p>

                                <p class="assignment">Kijk nu op hoeveel manieren de reflectie sensors van de robot de lijnen kunnen raken. Beschrijf per manier wat de robot moet doen om binnen de lijnen te blijven. Schrijf dit op de volgende manier op; &quot;<b>Als de [linker | rechter | beide] sensor de lijn detecteert, ... dan ... en ga dan ... </b>&quot;. </p>

                                <p class="assignment">Dus bijvoorbeeld: &quot;Als de linker sensor de lijn detecteert, draai dan 10 graden naar links en ga dan vooruit.&quot;</p>

                            </div>
                            <div style="clear:both; "></div>
                        </div>



                        <p>Je hebt nu in opdracht 11.1 bedacht wat de robot moet doen om netjes binnen de lijnen op de vloer te blijven. De programma regels die je gaat schrijven om dit te doen moeten herhaald worden zolang als de robot rijdt. Deze programma regels moeten dus in de functie <code>loop()</code> geplaatst worden. Er is alleen nog iets nodig in de functie <code>setup()</code> nodig om de robot goed te laten starten.</p>


                        <h3>Opdracht 11.2</h3>
                        <p class="assignment">Pak de rol tape en maak hiermee een rechthoek op de vloer. Maak de rechthoek groot genoeg zodat de robot er goed in kan rondrijden. Maar maak hem natuurlijk niet zo groot dat het heel lang duurt voordat de robot een lijn raakt. Later in de lessen zul je een veel grotere rechthoek mogen maken. Nu is een lengte van ėėn tot anderhalve meter per zijde van de rechthoek heel mooi.</p>

                        <p class="assignment">Zitten de lijnen mooi? Dan kun je de robot uitproberen. Zet de robot midden in het rechthoek en zet de <em>mode</em> schakelaar op stand <em>2</em>. Zet de robot dan aan, en wat gebeurt er ?</p>

                        <p class="assignment">Tja, er mist iets. De robot moet &egrave;&egrave;n ding doen zodra je hem aanzet! Open het programma &quot;Mijn_Robot&quot; en pas de functie <code>setup()</code> aan zodat de robot doet wat hij moet doen nadat je hem aanzet! Weet je het niet wat de robot moet doen ? Zet de <em>mode</em> schakelaar dan op stand <em>1</em> en zet de robot aan. Nu weet je het!</p>
                        <hr/>

                        <p>Tja nu beweegt de robot wel als je de <em>mode</em> schakelaar op <em>2</em> zet, maar blijft hij nog niet netjes binnen de lijnen! Dat ga je in de volgende opdracht oplossen.</p>

                        <h3>Opdracht 11.3</h3>

                        <p class="assignment">Programmeer nu de instructies die je met de papieren robot hebt uitgewerkt zodat de robot binnen de lijnen blijft. Wat moet de robot gaan doen om binnen de lijnen te blijven ?
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Als er geen lijn gedetecteerd wordt hoeft de robot alleen maar te (blijven!) rijden.</li>
                            <li>Als er links een lijn gedetecteerd wordt moet de robot</li>

                            <li>Als er rechts een lijn gedetecteerd wordt moet de robot</li>
                            <li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>naar achter rijden,</li>
                                    <li>naar links draaien,</li>
                                    <li>en weer verder rijden</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Als er links en rechts een lijn gedetecteerd wordt moet de robot</li>
                            <li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>naar achter rijden,</li>
                                    <li>omdraaien,</li>
                                    <li>en weer verder rijden</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Tip: Kijk nog eens naar de programma regels die je geschreven hebt voor het volgen van de lijn! </p>

                        <p class="assignment">Als je denkt dat het programma goed is, verstuur het dan naar de robot, zet de mode schakelaar op <em>2</em> en zet hem aan. Gaat er iets fout, kijk dan goed wat er fout gaat en probeer de fout in het programma te herstellen. Als je het helemaal niet meer begrijpt probeer dan één probleem per keer op te lossen. Als bijvoorbeeld de robot bij het raken van de lijn met de linker sensor niet doet wat jij wilt, zet de robot dan zo neer bij het testen dat hij altijd als eerste de linke lijn raakt. Soms helpt het ook om programma regels <em>uit</em> te zetten. Je kunt programmaregels makkelijk uit zetten door aan het begin van de regel <code>//</code> te typen. De robot weet dan dat het deze regels niet moet uitvoeren.</p>
                        <hr/>

                        <p>Zo nu ben je al een heel eind gekomen ! De robot blijft binnen de lijnen en rijdt zelfstandig rond. Alleen als er iets anders binnen de lijnen staat rijdt de robot er tegenaan omdat het nog niets kan zien. Dat gaan je nu in de volgende stappen programmeren. We beginnen eenvoudig en gaan het daarna wat moeilijker maken.</p>

                        <h3>Opdracht 11.4</h3>

                        <p class="assignment">Zoals gezegd we beginnen eenvoudig. Is het je al opgevallen dat de robot elke keer dat je hem aanzet een andere kant op kijkt ? Je weet daardoor eigenlijk nooit welke kant de robot opkijkt als je hem aanzet. Als je niet weet naar welke kant de robot kijkt, weet je straks ook niet of de robot nu de afstand links, voor of rechts van de robot meet.
                        </p>

                        <p class="assignment">Breid nu je programma &quot;Mijn_Robot&quot; uit zodat bij het aanzetten het hoofd van de robot altijd naar voren wijst.</p>
                        <hr/>

                        <p>Nu je weet dat de robot altijd begint met vooruitkijken wordt het meten van de afstand vanaf de voorkant van de robot een stuk eenvoudiger. Door tijdens het rijden van de robot de afstand te meten tot een voorwerp voor je kun je ervoor zorgen dat de robot niet tegen andere dingen in het gebied van de robot oprijdt. </p>

                        <h3>Opdracht 11.5</h3>

                        <p class="assignment">In deze opdracht ga je proberen om de robot te laten stoppen zodra er iets in de weg staat. Laat de robot ruim op tijd stoppen, dus stop als de robot iets ziet wat op 10 centimeter of minder voor de robot staat.
                        </p>

                        <p class="assignment">Begin met het meten van de afstand. Maak een variabele <code>afstand</code> en vul deze met de gemeten afstand. Let goed op waar je deze regel gaat plaatsen in je programma. Je moet de hele tijd dat de robot rijdt de afstand meten. Het is niet nodig, of zelfs beter van niet, om de afstand te meten als de robot een lijn detecteert. Weet je ook waarom niet ?</p>

                        <p class="assignment">Voeg nu de programmaregels toe welke ervoor zorgen dat de robot stopt als de afstand tussen de robot en een voorwerp kleiner is dan 10cm.</p>

                        <hr/>

                        <div style="">
                            <div style="float:left;width:49%;margin-right: 7px ">

                                <p>Je robot staat nu stil als er iets op zijn weg ligt, maar wat dan ? Wat moet de robot doen ?</p>

                                <p>Je kun de robot om laten draaien en verder rijden. Maar het kan ook slimmer, je kunt de robot ook om het obstakel heen laten rijden, zodat het zijn weg verder kan vervolgen.</p>

                                <p>Maar hoe kun je de robot nu het beste om een obstakel laten rijden? Kijk eens naar de afbeelding rechts. Op deze tekening staan drie lijnen getekend. Iedere lijn wijst in een andere richting, links, vooruit en rechts. Elke lijn geeft de afstand van de robot ten opzichte van het obstakel.</p>

                                <h3>Opdracht 11.6</h3>
                                <p class="assignment">Als de robot nu om het obstakel heen moet rijden, welke richting zou je hem dan sturen?</p>

                                <p class="assignment">De robot kan met zijn hoofd draaien en met de ogen de afstand van de robot tot een voorwerp meten. Als je nu hiermee links, vooruit en rechts van de robot de afstand meet en deze afstanden vergelijkt. Naar welke kant zou de robot moeten rijden de kortste, middelste of langst gemeten afstand ? </p>

                                <p class="assignment">Je robot kan nu rondrijden binnen de lijnen en stop als het 10cm voor zich iets ziet staan. Tijd om het programma &quot;Mijn_Robot&quot; weer verder uit te breiden. De robot moet nu gaan beslissen welke kant het op moet gaan rijden om het ding dat hij voor zich ziet staan heen te rijden.</p>

                                <p class="assignment">Breid het programma uit na de instructie regel <code>landjerobot.move(LandjeRobot::DIRECTION::STOP) ;</code> wanneer gemeten is dat de afstand tussen de robot en het voorwerp minder dan 10cm is. Zorg nu dat de robot de afstand links en rechts van zich meet. Vergelijk deze twee afstanden en zorg dat de robot nu de juiste kant op draait zodat het om het voorwerp heen rijdt.</p>


                                <p class="assignment">Tip: De robot meet de afstand beter als je na het draaien van het hoofd even wacht, 1 seconde is meer dan genoeg, voordat je de afstand meet.
                                </p>

                                <p class="assignment">Tijd om te testen ! Zet je robot neer, zet hem met de schakelaar op mode &quot;2&quot; en laat hem rijden binnen de lijnen. Pak nu een voorwerp en plaats deze ver genoeg voor de robot. Rijdt hij er omheen dan ben je geslaagd!
                                </p>

                        <h1 id="toc_19">Les 12, Verbeteren van je programma</h1>

                        <p>Je robot kan nu zelfstandig rondrijden. Maar zoals je waarschijnlijk al merkt gaat het nog niet altijd even goed. Soms raakt het nog het voorwerp dat in de weg staat of probeert robot het voorwerp opzij te duwen. Het kan zelfs nog voorkomen dat het over de lijnen rijdt en er vandoor gaat om de rest van de ruimte te verkennen.</p>

                        <p>In deze laatste les zitten nog vier opdrachten die je helemaal zelfstandig moet uitvoeren. </p>

                        <h3>Opdracht 12.1</h3>
                        <p class="assignment">Soms als de robot vlak voor een voorwerp moet draaien kan het zijn dat het tijdens het draaien te weinig ruimte heeft en het voorwerp opzij duwt. Hoe kun je dit voorkomen ? Pas het programma aan zodat het bij het draaien geen voorwerpen meer raakt. Heb je geen idee hoe je dit moet oplossen ? Pak dan je papieren robot, teken een obstakel op een vel papier rijd er mee naar het obstakel. Laat je robot draaien bij het obstakel en kijk of je zo ziet wat je moet doen om bij het draaien het obstakel niet te raken.</p>
                        <hr/>

                        <h3>Opdracht 12.2</h3>
                        <p class="assignment">Het is nooit leuk als je weer moet stoppen en ergens om heen moet rijden. Dit robot vindt dit ook niet laat de robot mopperen als er iets voor hem staat door het 5 seconden te laten praten!</p>
                        <hr/>

                        <h3>Opdracht 12.3</h3>
                        <p class="assignment">Ook als er soms niets voor de robot in de weg staat ziet het iets voor zich en gaat dan een andere kant op. Dit kan komen omdat de robot soms een fout meet. Dit kan komen door echo van het geluid waarmee gemeten wordt of door geluid van een andere robot. Je kunt de robot beter laten zien of er iets voor hem staat. Als de robot denkt dat er iets voor hem staat laat je hem bijvoorbeeld nog eens 5 keer achter elkaar meten. De gemeten afstanden tel je bij elkaar op. Als de opgetelde metingen kleiner is dan 5 keer de afstand waarop de robot zou moeten stoppen heeft de robot zeker goed gezien.</p>
                        <hr/>

                        <h3>Opdracht 12.4</h3>
                        <p class="assignment">Het kan zijn dat als er iets recht voor een robot staat er links en rechts nog minder afstand is. De robot kan er dan niet omheen rijden. Maak hier een oplossing voor en test het uit.</p>
                        <hr/>
