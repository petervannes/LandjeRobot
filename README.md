# Landje Robot

-- DRAFT -- 

## Introduction

Welcome to the Landje Robot repository. Landje Robot is an fully open source STEM robot. It is a common object avoidance and line following robot like many others. Landje Robot deviates in two aspects from many other builds. 

First, Landje Robot is fully documented. There is a [Preparation guide](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/Landje%20robot%20Kit%20preparation.html) which describes the bill of material, assembly of wire looms and other main parts and 3D printed parts. Next to the [Preparation guide](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/Landje%20robot%20Kit%20preparation.html) there is a [Student guide](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/Student%20guide%20NLD.html) with programming lessons. And documentation of the [Instruction Set](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20NLD.html).

Secondly, Landje Robot has its own instruction set. This instructionset simplifies the control of the sensors, motors, led and switch. With this instruction set and robot i made an attempt to create instruction material for kids who have overgrown the level of programming in Scratch. Programming in Scratch is a good starting point to grab the concepts of programming, but it has it's limitiations. (as this robot has it's own) 

Switching from the safe Scratch language to C is challenging with it syntax and runtime errors. Therefore the complexity of controlling the I/O ports to read sensor data or control the servo- and stepper motors is delegated to an instructionset. Moving the robot forward is now reduced to a `move ( direction )` instruction.

For documentation and components there has been made use of open source components and products as much as possible. Documentation is written in MarkDown and HTML format and made use of [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) for bitmaps and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) of vector oriented images.

## Documentation

### Preparation Guide

The [Preparation guide](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/Landje%20robot%20Kit%20preparation.html) documents how to prepare the robot kit and lessons. Yes, i have built this kit for instructional programming lessons. It is not suitable for children to follow the lessons on their own.

 


### Student Guide

The [Student guide](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/Student%20guide%20NLD.html) is currenly only available in Dutch.

### Instruction Set documentation

The [Instruction Set](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/petervannes/LandjeRobot/blob/master/Guides/instructionset%20NLD.html) is currently only available in Dutch.
